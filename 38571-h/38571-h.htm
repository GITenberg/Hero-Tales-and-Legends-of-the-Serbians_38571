<p class="first">Serbians attach the utmost value and importance to the
sympathies of such a highly cultured, great, and therefore legitimately
influential people as is the British nation. Since the beginning of the
twentieth century there have been two critical occasions<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e261src" href="#xd19e261" name=
"xd19e261src">1</a>&mdash;the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by
Austria and the war against the Turks&mdash;when we have had
opportunities to note how British sympathies, even when apparently only
platonic, can be of great practical importance for our nation. It is
quite natural that we should desire to retain and if possible deepen
and increase those sympathies. We are proud of our army, but we flatter
ourselves that our nation may win sympathy and respect by other than
military features of its national character. We wish that our British
friends should know our nation such as it is. We wish them to be
acquainted with our national psychology. And nothing could give a
better insight into the very soul of the Serbian nation than this
book.</p>
<p>The Serbians belong ethnologically to the great family of the
Slavonic nations. They are first cousins to the Russians, Poles,
Czechs, Slovaks, and Bulgars, and they are brothers to the Croats and
Slovenes. Since the Church has ceased to be the discordant and
disuniting element in the life of the nations, the Orthodox Serbians
and the Roman Catholic Croats are practically one and the same people.
But of all Slavonic nations the Serbians can legitimately claim to be
the most poetical one. Their language is the richest and the most
musical among all the Slavonic languages. The late Professor Morfill, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e266" href="#xd19e266" name=
"xd19e266">vi</a>]</span>man who was something of a Panslavist,
repeatedly said to me: &ldquo;I wish you Serbians, as well as all other
Slavonic nations, to join Russia in a political union, but I do not
wish you to surrender your beautiful and well-developed language to be
exchanged for the Russian!&rdquo; On one occasion he went even so far
as to suggest that the future United States of the Slavs should adopt
as their literary and official language the Serbian, as by far the
finest and most musical of all the Slavonic tongues.</p>
<p>When our ancestors occupied the western part of the Balkan
Peninsula, they found there numerous Latin colonies and Greek towns and
settlements. In the course of twelve centuries we have through
intermarriage absorbed much Greek and Latin blood. That influence, and
the influence of the commercial and political intercourse with Italy,
has softened our language and our manners and intensified our original
Slavonic love of what is beautiful, poetical, and noble. We are a
special Slavonic type, modified by Latin and Greek influences. The
Bulgars are a Slavonic nation of a quite different type, created by the
circulation of Tartar blood in Slavonian veins. This simple fact throws
much light on the conflicts between the Serbians and Bulgarians during
the Middle Ages, and even in our own days.</p>
<p>Now what are the Serbian national songs? They are not songs made by
cultured or highly educated poets&mdash;songs which, becoming popular,
are sung by common people. They are songs made by the common people
themselves. Up to the middle of the nineteenth century the Serbian
peasantry lived mostly in agricultural and family associations called
<i>Zadrooga</i>. As M. Petrovitch has stated, the sons of a peasant did
not leave their father&rsquo;s house when they got married, but built a
wooden cottage on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e275" href=
"#xd19e275" name="xd19e275">vii</a>]</span>land surrounding the
father&rsquo;s house. Very often a large settlement arose around the
original home, with often more than a hundred persons, men and women,
working together, considering the land and houses as their common
property, enjoying the fruits of their work as the common property too.
All the members of the Zadrooga considered the oldest member of such
family association as their chief, and it was the usual custom to
gather round him every evening in the original house. After questions
of farming or other business had been disposed of, the family gathering
would be enlivened by the chieftain or some other male member reciting
an epic song, or several such songs, describing historic events or
events which had lately happened. At the public gatherings around the
churches and monasteries groups of men and women would similarly gather
about the reciters of songs on old kings and heroes or on some great
and important event.</p>
<p>In Hungarian Serbia (Syrmia, Banat, Bachka) poor blind men often
make it a lucrative profession to sing old or new songs, mostly on old
heroes and historical events or on contemporary events. But in other
parts of Serbia (Shumadiya, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia)
very often well-to-do peasants recite the hero songs to crowds of
listeners of both sexes. It is a curious fact noticed already by Vouk
S. Karadgitch that the reciters of the heroic songs are hardly ever
young men, but generally men of middle age, and still more frequently
old men. It is as if old men considered it their duty to acquaint the
young generation with the principal events of the nation&rsquo;s
history and their principal heroes. You may find still many an
illiterate person in Serbia, but you will not find one who would not be
able to tell you something about Stephan Nemanya, the first king of
medi&aelig;val Serbia, about his son St. Sava, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e279" href="#xd19e279" name=
"xd19e279">viii</a>]</span>Tsar Doushan, his young son Ourosh, King
Voukashin<span class="corr" id="xd19e281" title=
"Not in source">,</span> the Royal Prince Kralyevitch Marko, Tsar
Lazar, and the heroes who fell in the famous battle at Kossovo (1389).
It can be said that the Serbian peasants wrote their own national
history by composing and reciting it from one generation to another in
the rhythmical ten-syllabic blank verse. The <i lang="sr">gooslari</i>
and the monks kept the national political consciousness and the
national Church fully alive through the five centuries in which they
were only Turkish <i>Rayah</i>, a mass of common people doomed to be
nothing better than slaves to their master, the Turk. We would to-day
not have known anything about the persistent guerilla war, which the
best and boldest men of the nation were relentlessly carrying on
against the nation&rsquo;s oppressor since the beginning of the
sixteenth century until the first rising of Shumadia under Karageorge
in 1804, if we had not the so-called <i lang="sr">Ha&iuml;doochke
Pesme</i> (the Songs on Ha&iuml;dooks). Long before the history of
<i>The Resurrection of the Serbian National State</i> had been written
by Stoyan Novakovich, the learned President of the Serbian Academy, the
bard Vishnyich described that resurrection in songs of great beauty and
power. And the victories of the Serbian army over the Turks and Bulgars
in the war of 1912&ndash;13 are already sung by the improvized bards in
the inns and at the great gatherings of the people at the village fairs
and around the churches on great church festivals. Of course, a Serbian
who has heard on hundreds of occasions national songs recited learns to
recite them himself, although he may not be able to accompany his
recitation on the <i>goussle</i>. Nor does he find it difficult, by
using many stereotyped lines of old and well-known songs, to tell the
story of a recent event. When in 1873, as Minister of Finance, I was
defeated in the Budget debate at the Skoupshtina, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e300" href="#xd19e300" name=
"xd19e300">ix</a>]</span>my defeat was recited to the people in blank
verse the same evening, and the next day.</p>
<p>Besides the songs which relate, more or less accurately, actual
events, many a national song relates a legend or a tradition. They have
been created, no doubt, under the influence of the priests and monks,
and are appropriate recitations to the crowds who come to the church
festivals. I am glad to see that M. Petrovitch has included in his
collection the song which is probably the oldest among all Serbian
songs. It is called &ldquo;The Saints partition [or divide] the
Treasures,&rdquo; and it gives expression to an evidently very old
tradition, which remembers a sort of catastrophe which befell India,
and which probably was the cause of the ancient ancestors of the Slavs
leaving India. It is most remarkable to find an echo of an Indian
catastrophe in the national songs of the Serbians.</p>
<p>That the Serbians had national songs in which they described the
exploits of their national heroes was noted in the fourteenth century.
Nicephoras Gregoras, sent by the Byzantine Emperor on a diplomatic
mission to Serbia, relates having heard the Serbians sing their
national songs on their heroes. The records of several diplomatic
missions, going from Vienna or Buda to Constantinople during the
sixteenth century, relate that the members heard people sing heroic
songs. In that century we have the first attempt to reproduce in print
some of those national songs, as, for instance, by the Ragusan poet
Hectorovich. In the eighteenth century fuller efforts were made by the
Franciscan monk Kachich-Mioshich and by Abb&eacute; Fortis. But it is
to the self-taught founder of modern Serbian literature, Vouk
Stephanovitch Karadgitch, that the greatest honour is due, as has been
shown by M. Petrovitch in his Introduction and elsewhere. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e306" href="#xd19e306" name=
"xd19e306">x</a>]</span></p>
<p>M. Petrovitch must have experienced what the French call <i>embarras
de richesses</i>. It was not so easy to select the songs for an English
translation<span class="corr" id="xd19e312" title="Source: ,">.</span>
But he has given us some of the finest Serbian epic songs as samples of
what the Serbian national poetry is capable of creating. I regret only
that he has not included a few samples of what the Serbian village
women and girls are able to produce in the way of lyrical poetry.
Perhaps on some other occasion he will make an <i lang="fr">amende
honorable</i> to our countrywomen.</p>
<p>I wish to add yet a few words to what M. Petrovitch has said about
our greatest national hero, the Royal Prince (Kralyevitch) Marko. As he
has pointed out, Marko is a historical personality. But what history
has to say about him is not much, and certainly not of the nature to
explain how he became the favourite hero of the Serbian people. He was
a loyal and faithful vassal of the Sultan, a fact hardly likely to win
him the respect and admiration of the Serbians. Yet the Serbians
throughout the last five centuries have respected, admired, loved their
Royal Prince Marko, and were and are now and will ever be proud of him.
This psychological puzzle has stirred up the best Serbian and some
other historical students and authors to investigate the matter. It is
evident to all that most of the songs on Marko must have been composed
under the mighty influence of his personality upon his contemporary
countrymen. Dr. Yagich, Dr. Maretich, Professor Stoykovich and St.
Novakovich all believe that his athletic strength and personal
appearance were responsible for much of the impression he made. All
agree that his conduct in everyday life and on all occasions was that
of a true knight, a <i lang="fr">cavaliere servente</i>, a <i lang=
"fr">chevalier sans peur et sans <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd19e325" href="#xd19e325" name="xd19e325">xi</a>]</span>reproche</i>.
Even his attachment and unfailing readiness to serve the Sultan was
counted in his favour, as proof of his absolute loyalty of character.
Probably that very loyalty was appreciated by the Sultan and enabled
Marko not rarely to appeal to the Sultan in favour of his people,
especially when some prisoners or slaves were to be liberated and
saved. He was certainly the protector of poor and suffering men and
women, and went to their rescue at all and every personal risk and
cost. He must have given real proofs of his devotion to the cause of
justice; that is what endeared him to his generation as well as to the
generations which followed. He must have been known during his life for
his fear of God and his respect and tender love for his mother. The
Serbians painted him from the model which his own personality and his
actual deeds offered to the nation. One of the most beautiful features
of his knightly character as described by the national bards is his
love of and pity for suffering animals. I regret that my friend
Petrovitch did not give a sample of the songs which glorify that
feature of our national hero, as, for instance, the song &ldquo;Marko
and the Falcon&rdquo; (Vouk. ii. 53), or &ldquo;Marko and the
Eagle&rdquo; (Vouk. ii. 54), in each of which it is described how when
once Marko fell ill on a field, an intense thirst tormenting him and
the scorching sun-rays burning his face, those birds out of gratitude
for the kindness Marko showed them once, brought to him water in their
beaks and spread their wings to shade his face against the sun.</p>
<p>By far the best study on the Serbian national hero has been written
by the Russian professor M. Halanski, who explains the puzzle by the
natural sympathy of the people for a &lsquo;tragic hero.&rsquo; The
historical Marko was certainly a &lsquo;tragic hero.&rsquo; Nothing
proves that better than his last <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd19e330" href="#xd19e330" name="xd19e330">xii</a>]</span>words before
the battle of Rovina began (1399), and which M. Petrovitch quotes in
the text.</p>
<p>I ought to add that there is also a theory that the Serbian nation,
so to say, projected itself in the Royal Prince Marko, depicting its
own tragic fate, its own virtues and weaknesses, in the popular yet
tragic personality of Marko. No doubt Marko must have been in some way
the representative type of a noble Serbian, otherwise he could not have
found the way to the soul and heart of his people. Yet that theory is
hardly modest, for my taste.</p>
<p>It may interest our British friends to know that a relation of the
dynasty of which Marko was the last representative, a certain Prince
John Mussachi, in a historical memoir stated that Marko&rsquo;s father,
King Voukashin, was the descendant of a certain nobleman named
Britanius or Britanicus!<a class="noteref" id="xd19e337src" href=
"#xd19e337" name="xd19e337src">2</a> We should be proud if it could be
proved that the ancestors of our national hero were in some way
connected with the Britons.</p>

<h2 id="xd19e1095" class="main">Introduction</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">More than once in the following pages I have lamented
my inability to translate into English verse the spirited ballads of
our national bards; never until now have I realized the error involved
in the dictum of my teachers of literature&mdash;true as it may be from
one point of view&mdash;that beautiful thoughts are to be more freely
expressed in prose than in a poetic form, which is necessarily hampered
by rules of prosody and metre. Undoubtedly, good prose is worth more
than mediocre verse, but how if the author be a master poet?</p>
<p>Serbian epic poetry undoubtedly deserves the attention of the
English literary world, and I venture to express the hope that some day
another English poet will be attracted as was Sir John Bowring by the
charm of our ballads, and like him will endeavour to communicate to
readers of English the alluring rhythmic qualities of the
originals.</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century various German poets
transversified some of our national ballads, and I cannot but boast
that among the number was even Goethe himself. Alas! he was compelled
to use Italian versions, for he was ignorant of the Serbian language,
unlike his worthy countryman Jacob Grimm, who, after having learnt our
musical tongue that he might acquaint himself with the treasures
written in it, wrote: &ldquo;The Serbian national poetry deserves
indeed a general attention.... On account of these ballads I think the
Serbian will now be universally studied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Tcheque<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1105src" href="#xd19e1105"
name="xd19e1105src">1</a> writer, Lyoodevit Schtur, speaking of the
Slav poetry, wrote: &ldquo;The Indo-European peoples express each in
their own manner what they contain in themselves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e1113" href="#xd19e1113" name=
"xd19e1113">xviii</a>]</span>and what elevates their souls. The Indian
manifests this in his huge temples; the Persian in his holy books; the
Egyptian in pyramids, obelisks and immeasurable, mysterious labyrinths;
the Hellene in his magnificent statues; the Roman in his enchanting
pictures; the German in his beautiful music&mdash;the Slavs have poured
out their soul and their intimate thoughts in ballads and
tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that it is not too much to claim that of all the Slavs,
Serbians have most profusely poured out their souls in their poetry,
which is thoroughly and essentially national. So much could not safely
be said about their tales and legends, which, to my mind, seem less
characteristic. Indeed, by their striking analogy with the folk lore of
other nations they help to demonstrate the prehistoric oneness of the
entire Aryan race. For example, it would be ridiculous for any nation
to lay exclusive claim, as &lsquo;national property,&rsquo; to such
legends as &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1117src"
href="#xd19e1117" name="xd19e1117src">2</a> and certain others, which
are found more or less alike in many languages, as is well known to
those who have any considerable acquaintance with European folk
lore.</p>
<p>From time immemorial the Serbian has possessed an exceptional
natural gift for composing heroic ballads. That gift was brought from
his ancient abode in the North; and the beautiful scenery of his new
surroundings, and contact with the civilized Byzantine, influenced it
very considerably and provided food for its development, so that it
came to resemble the Homeric epic rather than any product of the genius
of the Northern Slav. The treasure of his mental productions was
continually augmented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e1144" href=
"#xd19e1144" name="xd19e1144">xix</a>]</span>by new impressions, and
the national poetry thus grew opulent in its form and more beautiful in
its composition. The glorious forests of the Balkans, instinct with
legend and romance, to which truly no other forests in Europe can
compare; the ever-smiling sky of Southern Macedonia; the gigantic Black
Rocks of Montenegro and Herzegovina, are well calculated to inspire
even a less talented people than the Serbian inhabitants of those
romantic regions for the last thirteen centuries.</p>
<p>The untiring Serbian muse pursued her mission alike upon the
battlefield or in the forest, in pleasant pastures amid the flocks, or
beneath the frowning walls of princely castles and sacred monasteries.
The entire nation participated in her gracious gifts; and whenever a
poet chanted of the exploits of some favourite national hero, or of the
pious deeds of monk or saint, or, indeed, of any subject which appeals
closely to the people, there were never lacking other bards who could
make such poetic creations their own and pass them on with the
modifications which must always accompany oral transmission, and which
serve to bring them ever more intimately near to the heart of the
nation. This characteristic of oral transmission explains the existence
of varying versions of some of the most popular songs.</p>
<p>Through many centuries, and more especially during the blighting
domination of the Turk, Serbian national literature was limited to a
merely oral form, save that the untiring monks, inviolable within the
sacred walls of their monasteries, spent their leisure, not in
inscribing the popular ballads and lyric songs of their nation, but in
recording the biographies of other monks or of this or that princely
patron.</p>
<p>Those Serbians who could not endure the oppressive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e1152" href="#xd19e1152" name=
"xd19e1152">xx</a>]</span>rule of the Ottoman, and who in the
seventeenth century emigrated with their Patriarch Arsen Tcharnoyevitch
to the level fields of Southern Hungary&mdash;there to adopt in the
course of the two subsequent centuries the pseudo-classicism of the
West&mdash;considered it <i>infra dignitatem</i> to write about such
vulgar subjects as popular poetry and tradition. The gifted descendants
of those lamentable slaves of the cunning Austrian and Pan-Russian
influences wasted their talents in vain and empty imitation of
pseudo-classic productions from Italy and France, and, by conjugating
zealously the Serbian and Old-Slavonic verbs in the Russian fashion
they created a monstrous literary jargon which they termed
<i>Slavyano-Serbski</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Slavo-Serbian). And if any Serbian
author should have presumed to write in the melodious and genuine
Serbian as universally spoken throughout his fatherland, he would have
been anathematized by those misguided Slavo-Serbian
&lsquo;classicists&rsquo; who fondly believed that by writing in a
language hardly comprehensible even to themselves, because of its utter
inconsequence and arbitrary changes, they would surely become
distinguished in the history of their nation&rsquo;s literature.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;classicists&rsquo; received their deserts in the first
half of the nineteenth century, when they were overwhelmed by the
irresistible torrent of the popular movement headed by the self-taught
Serbian peasant, <span class="sc">Vouk Stephanovitch-Karadgitch</span>,
whose name will remain for ever great in the history of Serbian
literature. Karadgitch has been called justly &ldquo;the father of
Serbian modern literature.&rdquo; His numberless opponents, who began
by heaping upon him every opprobrious epithet which their pens or
tongues could command, ended, after more than fifty years of fruitless
resistance, by opening wide their arms to him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e1168" href="#xd19e1168" name=
"xd19e1168">xxi</a>]</span></p>
<p>Karadgitch framed a grammar of the popular Serbian language,
banishing all unnecessary graphic signs and adapting his
thirty-lettered alphabet to the thirty sounds (five vowels and
twenty-five consonants) of his mother tongue&mdash;thus giving it an
ideal phonetic orthography, and establishing the golden rule,
&ldquo;<i>Spell as you speak and speak as you
spell</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1175src" href="#xd19e1175"
name="xd19e1175src">3</a> He also travelled from one village to another
throughout Serbia, zealously collecting and inscribing the epic and
lyric poems, legends, and traditions as he heard them from the lips of
bards and story-tellers, professional and amateur.</p>
<p>In his endeavours he was powerfully seconded by the Serbian ruling
princes, and he had the good fortune to acquire the intimate friendship
of those distinguished philologers and scientists of the last century,
Bartholemy Kopitar, Schaffarik, and Grimm. Helped by Kopitar,
Karadgitch succeeded in compiling an academic dictionary of the Serbian
language interpreted by Latin and German equivalents. This remains to
this day the only reliable Serbian dictionary approaching to the
Western standard of such books. His first collection of Serbian popular
poems was published in Vienna in 1814. It contained 200 lyric songs,
which he called <i lang="sr">zenske pyesme</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
&lsquo;women-songs&rsquo;), and 23 heroic ballads, and the book created
a stir in literary circles in Austria, Serbia, Germany, Russia, and
other countries. Seven years later Karadgitch published at Leipzig a
second edition in three books. This contained 406 lyric songs and 117
heroic poems. From this edition Sir John Bowring made his metrical
translation of certain of the lyric and epic poems, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e1189" href="#xd19e1189" name=
"xd19e1189">xxii</a>]</span>which he published in 1827 under the title
<i>Servian Popular Poetry</i>. He dedicated the book to Karadgitch, who
was his intimate friend and teacher of Serbian.</p>
<p>I have reproduced three of Bowring&rsquo;s ballads in this book that
English readers may have a better idea than they can obtain from a mere
prose rendering of the original verse. As to the poetic merits of these
metrical translations I will not presume to offer an opinion, but I may
be permitted to say that I have not seen a more faithful translation of
our national ballads and lyric songs in English or in any other
language. Considering the difficulties to the Anglo-Saxon student of
any Slavonic language (more especially Serbian) it is surprising that
there should be so few defects in Bowring&rsquo;s work. Sir John must
have possessed an uncommon gift for acquiring languages, as he has also
translated from each of the other Slavonic tongues with&mdash;so I am
informed&mdash;similar accuracy and precision.</p>
<p>The third edition of Karadgitch&rsquo;s work appeared in Vienna at
intervals between the years 1841 and 1866. It had now grown to five
volumes and contained 1112 lyric songs and 313 heroic ballads. It is
from this edition that I have selected the hero-tales in this book; and
if I should succeed in interesting a new generation of English readers
in the literature of my country it will be my further ambition to
attempt the immeasurably harder task of introducing them in a
subsequent volume to our popular lyric poetry.</p>
<p>It remains only to tender my most grateful acknowledgment to my
esteemed friend M. Chedo Miyatovich for his invaluable advice and
encouragement, and for his generous willingness to contribute the
preface which adorns my book.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1209" class="main">The Coming of the Serb</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Prior to their incursion into the Balkan Peninsula
during the seventh century, the Serbians<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e1213src" href="#xd19e1213" name="xd19e1213src">1</a> lived as a
patriarchal people in the country now known as Galicia. Ptolemy, the
ancient Greek geographer, describes them as living on the banks of the
River Don, to the north-east of the sea of Azov. They settled mostly in
those Balkan territories which they inhabit at the present day, namely,
the present kingdom of Serbia, Old Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Batchka, Banat, Croatia, Sirmia and
Istria. The ancient inhabitants of those regions, Latins, Illyrians,
Thracians, Greeks and Albanians, were easily driven by the newcomers
toward the Adriatic coast. Their Emperor, Heraclius (<span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 610&ndash;641), unable to oppose an effective
resistance, ceded to the Serbians all the provinces which they had
occupied, and peace was thus purchased. The pagan and uncultured
Serbian tribes now came into constant intercourse with the civilized
Byzantines, and soon were converted to Christianity; for it is an
almost invariable fact that when one people conquers or subjects
another people, the more civilized of the two, whether the vanquished
or the victorious, must necessarily impose its civilization and customs
on the more barbarous. But the Serbians only embraced Christianity to
any large extent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>with the beginning of the ninth century, when the
two brothers Cyrillos and Methodius&mdash;the so-called Slavonic
apostles&mdash;translated and preached the teaching of Christ in the
ancient Slav language, then in common use among all southern Slavs of
that time.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1222" class="main">Early Struggles</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the Serbians, during the seventh and eighth
centuries, were divided into tribes, they became an easy prey to the
attacks of the Byzantines, the Bulgars and the Francs, although they
never were subjugated by any of those neighbours. The Serbians,
however, were forced to realize that only by concentration of their
power could they offer resistance as a nation, and a serious effort was
made to found a State on the banks of the River Morava, with Horea
Margi (now called Tyoupriya) as its capital, in the early part of the
ninth century. Owing to Bulgarian hostility, however, this proved
abortive.</p>
<p>A fresh attempt to form an independent State was made by the Djoupan
(Count) Vlastimir, who had succeeded in emancipating himself from
Byzantine suzerainty. This province was called Rashka and extended
around the Rivers Piva, Tara, and Lim, touching the basin of the River
Ibar in the east and that of Vrbas in the west. But in the very
beginning of its civil life there were dissensions amongst the leaders
which facilitated the interference of the Bulgarian Tsar Sim&eacute;on.
Tchaslav, the djoupan of another Serbian tribe, though he possessed no
rights to it, claimed the throne, and was supported by Sim&eacute;on,
who successfully invaded Rashka. The Bulgarians retained possession of
the country for seven years (924&ndash;931), when Tchaslav succeeded in
wresting from them a new state which comprised, together with Rashka,
the territories of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>Zetta, Trebinye, Neretva and Houm. After his death,
great disorder reigned in this principality.</p>
<p>In the course of the next century the Byzantine Empire, having again
brought the now enfeebled Bulgaria within its rule, also overpowered
Rashka, whose Grand Djoupan fled. The ruler of Zetta, Stephen
Vo&iuml;slav (1034&ndash;1051), son of Dragomir, djoupan of Trebinye,
took the opportunity of declaring himself independent of his suzerain
the Grand Djoupan of Rashka, and appropriated Zahoumlye (Herzegovina)
and some other regions. His son Michaylo (1053&ndash;1081) succeeded
further in bringing Rashka under his authority, and obtained the title
of king (<i>rex Sclavorum</i>) from Pope Gregory VII in the year 1077.
Under the rule of King Bodin, the son of Michaylo, the Serbia of
Tchaslav was restored; furthermore Bosnia was added to his state. But
after Bodin&rsquo;s death new disorder ensued, caused mainly by the
struggles amongst the several pretenders to the throne.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1236" class="main">Internecine Strife</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Internecine strife is an unfortunate feature to be
noticed throughout Serbian history, and constantly we see energy wasted
in futile dissensions among various members of ruling families, who
criminally and fatally neglected national interests, in pursuit by
legitimate or illegitimate means of their personal ambitions. This has
at all times hindered the Serbian nation from becoming a powerful
political unit, although efforts were made by many of the rulers to
realize this policy.</p>
<p>In 1169 a dynasty destined to rule Serbia for more than two
centuries (1169&ndash;1372) within ever-changing political boundaries,
was founded by the celebrated Grand Djoupan Stephan Nemanya
(1169&ndash;1196) who was created Duke <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>(grand djoupan) of Serbia by
the Byzantine Emperor after he had instigated a revolution, the result
of which was favourable to his pretensions. By his bravery and wisdom
he succeeded not only in uniting under his rule the provinces held by
his predecessors, but also in adding those which never had been Serbian
before, and he placed Ban Koulin, an ally, upon the throne of Bosnia.
Furthermore he strengthened the orthodox religion in his state by
building numerous churches and monasteries, and by banishing the
heretic Bogoumils.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1244src" href=
"#xd19e1244" name="xd19e1244src">2</a> Feeling the weakness of advanced
age, and wishing to give fresh proof of his religious faith to his
people, the aged Nemanya abdicated in 1196, in favour of his able
second son Stevan, and withdrew into a monastery. On his accession in
the year 1217 Stevan assumed the title of King of Serbia.</p>
<p>When the crusaders vanquished Constantinople, Sava, Stevan&rsquo;s
youngest brother, obtained from the Greek patriarch the autonomy of the
Serbian Church (1219), and became the first Serbian archbishop.</p>
<p>Stevan was succeeded by his son Radoslav (1223&ndash;1233), who was
dethroned by his brother Vladislav (1233&ndash;1242), who was removed
from the throne by his third brother Ourosh the Great
(1242&ndash;1276). Ourosh increased his territory and established the
reputation of Serbia abroad. In his turn, he was dethroned by his son
Dragoutin (1276&ndash;1281), who, owing to the failure of a campaign
against the Greeks, retired from the throne in favour of a younger
brother Miloutin (1281&ndash;1321), reserving, however, for himself a
province in the north of the State. Soon afterward Dragoutin received
from his mother-in-law, the queen of Hungary, the lands between the
Rivers Danube <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>Sava and Drina, and assumed the title of King of
Sirmia<span class="corr" id="xd19e1253" title="Source: ,">.</span>
Dragoutin, while still alive, yielded his throne and a part of his
lands to Miloutin, and another part remained under the suzerainty of
the King of Hungary. Miloutin is considered one of the most remarkable
descendants of Nemanya. After his death the usual discord obtained
concerning the succession to the throne. Order was re-established by
Miloutin&rsquo;s son, Stevan Detchanski (1321&ndash;1331), who defeated
the Bulgarians in the famous battle of Velbouzd, and brought the whole
of Bulgaria under his sway. Bulgaria remained a province of Serbia
until the Ottoman hordes overpowered both.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Stevan Detchanski was dethroned by his son Doushan the
Powerful (1331&ndash;1355), the most notable and most glorious of all
Serbian sovereigns. He aimed to establish his rule over the entire
Balkan Peninsula, and having succeeded in overpowering nearly the whole
of the Byzantine Empire, except Constantinople, he proclaimed himself,
in agreement with the <i>Vlastela</i> (Assembly of Nobles), Tsar of
Serbia. He elevated the Serbian archbishopric to the dignity of the
patriarchate. He subdued the whole of Albania and a part of Greece,
while Bulgaria obeyed him almost as a vassal state. His premature death

not permit him to realize the whole of his great plan for Serbia, and
under the rule of his younger son Ourosh (1355&ndash;1371) nearly all
his magnificent work was undone owing to the incessant and insatiable
greed of the powerful nobles, who thus paved the way for the Ottoman
invasion.</p>
<p>Among those who rebelled against the new Tsar was <span class=

the mountain Shar.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1268src" href=

<p>King Voukashin and his brother were defeated in a battle with the
Turks on the banks of the River Maritza (1371), and all Serbian lands
to the south of Skoplye (&Uuml;sk&uuml;b) were occupied by the
Turks.</p>

(<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1371) Knez<a class="noteref" id=

Lazar, a relative of Tsar Doushan the Powerful, to be the ruler of
Serbia, and Marko, from his principality of Prilip, as a vassal of the
Sultan, aided the Turks in their campaigns against the Christians. In
the year 1399 he met his death in the battle of Rovina, in Roumania,
and he is said to have pronounced these memorable words: &ldquo;May God
grant the victory to the Christians, even if I have to perish amongst
the first!&rdquo; The Serbian people, as we shall see, believe that he
did not die, but lives even to-day.</p>
<p>Knez Lazar ruled from 1371 to 1389, and during his reign he made an
alliance with Ban<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1286src" href="#xd19e1286"

Tvrtko proclaimed himself King of Bosnia, and endeavoured to extend his

Serbian princes, prepared for a great war against the <span class=

Sultan Amourath, informed of Lazar&rsquo;s intentions, suddenly
attacked the Serbians on June 15 1389, on the field of Kossovo. The
battle was furious on both sides, and at noon the position of the
Serbians promised ultimate success to their arms.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was, however, treachery in the Serbian camp.
Vook (Wolf) Brankovitch, one of the great lords, to whom was entrusted
one wing of the Serbian army, had long been jealous of his sovereign.
Some historians state that he had arranged with Sultan Amourath to
betray his master, in return for the promise of the imperial crown of
Serbia, subject to the Sultan&rsquo;s overlordship. At a critical
moment in the battle, the traitor turned his horse and fled from the
field, followed by 12,000 of his troops, who believed this to be a
stratagem intended to deceive the Turks. This was a great blow to the
Serbians, and when, later in the day the Turks were reinforced by fresh
troops under the command of the Sultan&rsquo;s son, Bajazet, the
Turkish victory was complete. Knez Lazar was taken prisoner and
beheaded, and the Sultan himself perished by the hand of a Serbian
vo&iuml;vode,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1296src" href="#xd19e1296"
name="xd19e1296src">6</a> Milosh Obilitch.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the disaster, in which Brankovitch also perished,
the Serbian state did not succumb to the Turks, thanks to the wisdom
and bravery of Lazar&rsquo;s son, Stevan Lazarevitch (1389&ndash;1427).
His nephew, Dyourady Brankovitch (1427&ndash;1456), also fought
heroically, but was compelled, inch by inch, to cede his state to the
Turks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the death of Dyourady the Serbian nobles could
not agree concerning his successor, and in the disorder that ensued the
Turks were able to complete their conquest of Serbia, which they
finally achieved by 1459. Their statesmen now set themselves the task
of inducing the Serbian peasantry in Bosnia, by promises of future
prosperity, to take the oath of allegiance to the Sultan, and in this
they were successful during the reign of the King of Bosnia, Stevan
Tomashevitch, who endeavoured in vain to secure help from the Pope. The
subjugation of Bosnia was an accomplished fact by 1463, and Herzegovina
followed by 1482. An Albanian chief of Serbian origin, George
Kastriotovitch-Skander-Beg (1443&ndash;1468), successfully fought, with
great heroism, for the liberty of Albania. Eventually, however, the
Turks made themselves master of the country as well as of all Serbian
lands, with the exception of Montenegro, which they never could subdue,
owing partly to the incomparable heroism of the bravest
Serbians&mdash;who objected to live under Turkish rule&mdash;and partly
to the mountainous nature of the country. Many noble Serbian families
found a safe refuge in that land of the free; many more went to Ragusa
as well as to the Christian Princes of Valahia and Moldavia. The cruel
and tyrannous nature of Turkish rule forced thousands of families to
emigrate to Hungary, and the descendants of these people may be found
to-day in Batchka, Banat, Sirmia and Croatia. Those who remained in
Serbia were either forced to embrace Islam or to live as <i>raya</i>
(slaves), for the Turkish <i>spahis</i> (land-lords) not only oppressed
the Christian population, but confiscated the land hitherto belonging
to the natives of the soil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=

<p class="first">We should be lengthening this retrospect unduly if we
were to describe in full the miserable position of the vanquished
Christians, and so we must conclude by giving merely an outline of the
modern period.</p>
<p>When it happens that a certain thing, or state of things, becomes
too sharp, or <i>acute</i>, a change of some sort must necessarily take
place. As the Turkish atrocities reached their culmination at the end
of the XVIIth century, the Serbians, following the example of their
brothers in Hungary and Montenegro, gathered around a leader who was
sent apparently by Providence to save them from the shameful oppression
of their Asiatic lords. That leader, a gifted Serbian, George
Petrovitch&mdash;designated by the Turks Karageorge (&lsquo;Black
George&rsquo;)&mdash;gathered around him other Serbian notables, and a
general insurrection occurred in 1804. The Serbians fought
successfully, and established the independence of that part of Serbia
comprised in the pashalik of Belgrade and some neighbouring territory.
This was accomplished only by dint of great sacrifices and through the
characteristic courage of Serbian warriors, and it was fated to endure
for less than ten years.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1332" class="main">Serbia again Subjugated</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Europe (and more particularly Russia) was engaged
in the war against Napoleon, the Turks found in the pre-occupation of
the Great Powers the opportunity to retrieve their losses and Serbia
was again subjugated in 1813. George Petrovitch and other Serbian
leaders left the country to seek aid, first in Austria, and later in
Russia. In their absence, Milosh Obrenovitch, one of Karageorge
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>Petrovitch&rsquo;s lieutenants, made a fresh
attempt to liberate the Serbian people from the Turkish yoke, and in
1815 was successful in re-establishing the autonomy of the Belgrade
pashalik. During the progress of his operations, George Petrovitch
returned to Serbia and was cruelly assassinated by order of Milosh who
then proclaimed himself hereditary prince and was approved as such by
the Sublime Porte in October 1815. Milosh was a great opponent of
Russian policy and he incurred the hostility of that power and was
forced to abdicate in 1839 in favour of his son Michel (Serbian
&lsquo;Mihaylo&rsquo;). Michel was an excellent diplomat, and had
previously incorporated within the independent state of Serbia several
districts without shedding blood. He was succeeded by Alexandre
Karageorgevitch (1842&ndash;1860) son of Karageorge Petrovitch. Under
the prudent rule of that prince, Serbia obtained some of the features
of a modern constitution and a foundation was laid for further and
rapid development. But an unfortunate foreign policy, the corruption
existing among the high dignitaries of the state and especially the
treachery of Milosh&rsquo;s apparent friends, who hoped to supplant
him, forced that enlightened prince to abandon the throne and to leave
his country. The Skoupshtina (National Assembly) restored Milosh but
the same year the prince died and was succeeded once again by his son
Michel (1860&ndash;1868). At the assassination of this prince his young
cousin, Milan (1868&ndash;1889), ruled with the aid, during his
minority, of three regents, in conformity of a Constitution voted in
1869.</p>
<p>The principal events during the rule of Milan were: the war against
Turkey (1876&ndash;1878) and the annexation of four new districts; the
acknowledgment of Serbian independence by the famous Treaty of Berlin;
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>proclamation of Serbia as a kingdom in 1882; the
unfortunate war against Bulgaria, which was instigated by Austria, and
the promulgation of a new Constitution, which, slightly modified, is
still in force.</p>
<p>After the abdication of King Milan, his unworthy son, Alexander,
ascended the throne. Despite the vigorous advices of his friends and
the severe admonishments of his personal friend M. Chedo Miyatovich, he
married his former mistress, Draga Mashin, under whose influence he
entered upon a period of tyranny almost Neronian in type. He went so
far as to endeavour to abolish the Constitution, thus completely
alienating his people and playing into the hands of his personal
enemies, who finally murdered him (1903).</p>

<p>Brief as is this retrospect it will suffice to show the
circumstances and conditions from which sprung the Serbian national
poetry with which we shall be largely concerned in the following pages.
The legends have their roots in disasters due as much to the
self-seeking of Serbian leaders as to foreign oppressors; but national
calamities have not repressed the passionate striving of a <span class=

to suffer ere they gain the place among the great nations which their
persistence and suffering must surely win in the end. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Serbians inhabiting the present kingdom of Serbia,
having been mixed with the ancient indigenous population of the Balkan
Peninsula, have not conserved their true national type. They have
mostly brown visages and dark hair; very rarely are blonde or other
complexions to be seen. Boshnyaks (Serbians inhabiting Bosnia) are
considered to be the most typical Serbians, they having most strongly
retained the national characteristics of the pure Southern-Slavonic
race. The average Serbian has a rather lively temperament; he is highly
sensitive and very emotional. His enthusiasm is quickly roused, but
most emotions with him are, as a rule, of short duration. However, he
is extremely active and sometimes persistent. Truly patriotic, he is
always ready to sacrifice his life and property for national interests,
which he understands particularly well, thanks to his intimate
knowledge of the ancient history of his people, transmitted to him from
generation to generation through the pleasing medium of popular epic
poetry composed in very simple decasyllabic blank verse&mdash;entirely
Serbian in its origin. He is extremely courageous and always ready for
war. Although patriarchal and conservative in everything national, he
is ready and willing to accept new ideas. But he has remained behind
other countries in agricultural and industrial pursuits. Very
submissive in his <i>Zadrooga</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e1367src"
href="#xd19e1367" name="xd19e1367src">1</a> and obedient to his
superiors, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>he is often despotic when elevated to power. The
history of all the Southern Slavs pictures a series of violations,
depositions, political upheavals, achieved sometimes by the most cruel
means and acts of treachery; all mainly due to the innate and hitherto
inexpugnable faults characteristic of the race, such as jealousy and an
inordinate desire for power. These faults, of course, have been most
apparent in the nobles, hence the decay of the ancient aristocracy
throughout the Balkans.</p>

<p class="first">There is available but slender material concerning the
pre-Christian history of the Southern-Slavonic races, and their worship
of Nature has not been adequately studied. Immediately after the
Slavonic immigration into the Balkan Peninsula during the seventh and
eighth centuries, Christianity, which was already deeply rooted in the
Byzantines, easily destroyed the ancient faith. The last survivors of
paganism lived in the western part of the peninsula, in the regions
round the river Neretva, and these were converted to Christianity
during the reign of Basil I. A number of Croatians had been converted
to Christianity as early even as the seventh century, and had
established an episcopate at Agram (Zagreb). In the course of some
thousand years Gr&aelig;co-Oriental myths and legends, ancient Illyrian
and Roman propaganda and Christian legends and apocryphal writings
exercised so great an influence upon the ancient religions of the
Southern-Slavonic peoples that it is impossible to unravel from the
tangled skein of such evidence as is available a purely
Southern-Slavonic mythology. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=

villages where one does not see the iris growing by the side of the
house-leek (<i>Tchuvar-Koutchye</i>). The Serbians say that the god
lives still in the person of St. Elias (Elijah), and Serbian peasants
believe that this saint possesses the power of controlling lightning
and thunder. They also believe that St. Elias has a sister

deities&mdash;which still occupy a considerable place in the national

&ldquo;<span class="trans" title="potami"><span class="Greek" lang=

mentioned by the Greek historian Procope, as inferior female divinities
inhabiting groves, forests, fountains, springs or lakes, seem to have
been retained in the Serbian popular <i>Veela</i> (or
<i>Vila</i>&mdash;in the singular; <i>Veele</i> or <i>Vile</i>&mdash;in
the plural). There are several fountains called &ldquo;Vilin
Izvor&rdquo; in Montenegro (<i>e.g.</i> on Mount Kom), as also in the
district of Rudnik in Serbia. During the Renaissance the Serbian poets
of Ragusa and other cities of Dalmatia made frequent reference to the
<i>nymphs</i>, <i>dryads</i>, and <i>oreads</i> beloved by them as
&ldquo;veele.&rdquo; The Serbian bards or troubadours from the early
fourteenth century to our day have ever glorified and sung of the
veele, describing them as very beautiful and eternally young, robed in
the whitest and finest gauze, with shimmering golden hair flowing down
over snow-white bosoms. Veele were said to have the most sweet voices
and were sometimes armed with bows and arrows. Their melodious songs
were often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>heard on the borders of the lakes or in the
meadows hidden deep in the forests, or on high mountain-peaks beyond
the clouds. They also loved to dance, and their rings are called
&lsquo;Vrzino (or <i>Vilino</i>) Kollo.&rsquo; In Mount Kom in
Montenegro, there is one of these rings which measures about twenty
metres across and is called &lsquo;Vilino Kollo.&rsquo; The Treaty of
Berlin mentions another situated between Vranya and K&uuml;standil,
through which ran the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier. When veele were dancing
nobody dare disturb them, for they could be very hostile to men. Like
the Greek nymphs, veele could also be amicably disposed; and on
occasions they assisted the heroes. They could become the sisters of
men and of women, and could even marry and have off-springs. But they
were not by any means invulnerable. Prince Marko, the favourite hero of
the Serbians, was endowed with superhuman strength by a veela who also
presented him with a most wonderful courser, &lsquo;Sharatz,&rsquo;
which was, indeed, almost human. A veela also became his
<i>possestrima</i> (Spiritual sister, or &lsquo;sister-in-God&rsquo;)
and when Marko was in urgent need of help, she would descend from the
clouds and assist him. But she refused to aid him if he fought in duels
on Sundays. On one occasion<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1465src" href=
"#xd19e1465" name="xd19e1465src">3</a> Marko all but slew the Veela
Raviyoyla who wounded his <i>pobratim</i> (brother-in-God) Vo&iuml;vode
Milosh. The veele were wise in the use of herbs, and knew the
properties of every flower and berry, therefore Raviyoyla could heal
the wounds of Milosh, and his pierced heart was &ldquo;sounder than
ever before.&rdquo; They believed in God and St. John, and abhorred the
Turk. The veele also possessed the power of clairvoyance, and Prince
Marko&rsquo;s &lsquo;sister-in-God&rsquo; prophesied his death and that
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=

tempests and other phenomena of nature; they could change themselves
into snakes or swans. When they were offended they could be very cruel;
they could kill or take away the senses of any who threatened them with

<p>To veele was attributed also the power of deciding the destiny of
newly born children. On the seventh night after the birth of a child
the Serbian peasant woman watches carefully for the <i>Oossood</i>, a
veela who will pronounce the destiny of her infant, and it is the
mother only who can hear the voice of the fairy.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1491" class="main">Predestination and Immortality</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Serbians believe firmly in predestination, and
they say that &ldquo;there is no death without the appointed day&rdquo;
(<i lang="sr">Nema smrti bez soodyena dana</i>). They believe
universally in the immortality of the soul, of which even otherwise
inanimate objects, such as forests, lakes, mountains, sometimes
partake. After the death of a man, the soul delays its departure to the
higher or lower spheres until the expiration of a certain period
(usually forty days), during which time it floats in the air, and can
perhaps enter into the body of some animal or insect.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1499" class="main">Good and Evil Spirits</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spirits are usually good; in Montenegro the people
believe that each house has its Guardian-Spirit, whom they call
<i lang="sr">syen</i> or <i lang="sr">syenovik</i>. Such syens can
enter into the body of a man, a dog, a snake, or even a hen. In the
like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>manner every forest, lake, and mountain has each
its syen, which is called by a Turkish word <i>djin</i>. So, for
example, the djin of the mountain Riyetchki Kom, near the northern side
of the lake of Scutari, does not allow passers-by to touch a branch or
a leaf in the perpetually green woods on the mountain side, and if any
traveller should gather as much as a flower or a leaf he is instantly
pursued by a dense fog and perceives miraculous and terrifying visions
in the air. The Albanians dread similar spirits of the woods in the
region round Lurya, where they do not dare touch even the dry branches
of fallen firs and larches. This recalls the worship of sacred bushes
common among the ancient Lithuanians.</p>
<p>Besides the good spirits there appear evil spirits (<i lang=
"sr">byess</i>), demons, and devils (<i lang="sr">dyavo</i>), whom the
Christians considered as pagan gods, and other evil spirits (<i lang=
"sr">zli doossi</i>) too, who exist in the bodies of dead or of living
men. These last are called <i lang="sr">vookodlaks</i> or
<i>Vlkodlaks</i> (i.e. <i lang="sr">vook</i>, meaning
&lsquo;wolf,&rsquo; and <i lang="sr">dlaka</i>, meaning
&lsquo;hair&rsquo;), and, according to the popular belief, they cause
solar and lunar eclipses. This recalls the old Norse belief that the
sun and moon were continually pursued by hungry wolves, a similar
attempt to explain the same natural phenomena. Even to-day Serbian
peasants believe that eclipses of the sun and moon are caused by their
becoming the prey of a hungry dragon, who tries to swallow them. In
other parts of Serbia it is generally believed that such dragons are
female beings. These mischievous and very powerful creatures are
credited with the destruction of cornfields and vineyards, for they are
responsible for the havoc wrought by the hail-carrying clouds. When the
peasants observe a partial eclipse of the moon or the sun, believing
that a hailstorm is imminent, they gather in the village <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>streets,
and all&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;beat pots and pans
together, fire pistols, and ring bells in order to frighten away the
threatening monster.</p>
<p>In Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bocca Cattaro the people believe
that the soul of a sleeping man is wafted by the winds to the summit of
a mountain, and, when a number of such has assembled, they become
fierce giants who uproot trees to use as clubs and hurl rocks and
stones at one another. Their hissing and groans are heard especially
during the nights in spring and autumn. Those struggling crowds are not
composed merely of human souls, but include the spirits of many
animals, such as oxen, dogs, and even cocks, but oxen especially join
in the struggles.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1543" class="main">Witches</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Female evil spirits are generally called <i lang=
"sr">veshtitze</i> (singular, <i lang="sr">veshtitza</i>, derived
obviously from the ancient Bohemian word <i>ved</i>, which means
&lsquo;to know&rsquo;), and are supposed to be old women possessed by
an evil spirit, irreconcilably hostile to men, to other women, and most
of all to children. They correspond more or less to the English
conception of &lsquo;witches.&rsquo; When an old woman goes to sleep,
her soul leaves her body and wanders about till it enters the body of a
hen or, more frequently, that of a black moth. Flying about, it enters
those houses where there are a number of children, for its favourite
food is the heart of an infant. From time to time veshtitze meet to
take their supper together in the branches of some tree. An old woman
having the attributes of a witch may join such meetings after having
complied with the rules prescribed by the experienced veshtitze, and
this is usually done by pronouncing certain stereotyped phrases. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>peasants endeavour to discover such creatures,
and, if they succeed in finding out a witch, a jury is hastily formed
and is given full power to sentence her to death. One of the most
certain methods used to discover whether the object of suspicion is
really a witch or not, is to throw the victim into the water, for if
she floats she is surely a witch. In this case she is usually burnt to
death. This test was not unknown in England.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1559" class="main">Vampires</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The belief in the existence of vampires is universal
throughout the Balkans, and indeed it is not uncommon in certain parts
of western Europe. Some assert that this superstition must be connected
with the belief generally held in the Orthodox Church that the bodies
of those who have died while under excommunication by the Church are
incorruptible, and such bodies, being taken possession of by evil
spirits, appear before men in lonely places and murder them. In
Montenegro vampires are called <i>lampirs</i> or <i>tenatz</i>, and it
is thought that they suck the blood of sleeping men, and also of cattle
and other animals, returning to their graves after their nocturnal
excursions changed into mice. In order to discover the grave where the
vampire is, the Montenegrins take out a black horse, without blemish,
and lead it to the cemetery. The suspected corpse is dug up, pierced
with stakes and burnt. The authorities, of course, are opposed to such
superstitious practices, but some communities have threatened to
abandon their dwellings, and thus leave whole villages deserted, unless
allowed to ensure their safety in their own way. The code of the
Emperor Doushan the Powerful provides that a village in which bodies of
dead persons have been exhumed and burnt <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>shall be punished as
severely as if a murder had been committed; and that a <i>resnik</i>,
that is, the priest who officiates at a ceremony of that kind, shall be
anathematized. Militchevitch, a famous Serbian ethnographist, relates
an incident where a resnik, as late as the beginning of the nineteenth
century, read prayers out of the apocrypha of Peroon when an exorcism
was required. The revolting custom has been completely suppressed in
Serbia. In Montenegro the Archbishop Peter II. endeavoured to uproot
it, but without entire success. In Bosnia, Istria and Bulgaria it is
also sometimes heard of. The belief in vampires is a superstition
widely spread throughout Roumania, Albania and Greece.<a class=

<h3 id="xd19e1595" class="main">Nature Worship</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Even in our own day there are traces of sun and moon
worship, and many Serbian and Bulgarian poems celebrate the marriage of
the sun and the moon, and sing <i lang="sr">Danitza</i> <span class=
"corr" id="xd19e1602" title="Not in source">(</span>the morning star)
and <i lang="sr">Sedmoro Bratye</i> (&lsquo;The Seven

"xd19e1608src" href="#xd19e1608" name="xd19e1608src">7</a> Every man
has his own star, which appears in the firmament at the moment of his
birth and is extinguished when he dies. Fire and lightning are also
worshipped. It is common belief that the earth rests on water, that the
water reposes on a fire and that that fire again is upon another fire,
which is called <i lang="sr">Zmayevska Vatra</i> (&lsquo;Fire of the
Dragons&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Similarly the worship of animals has been preserved to our times.
The Serbians consider the bear to be no less than a man who has been
punished and turned into an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>animal. This they believe because the
bear can walk upright as a man does. The Montenegrins consider the
jackal (<i>canis aureus</i>) a semi-human being, because its howls at
night sound like the wails of a child. The roedeer (<i>capreolus
caprea</i>) is supposed to be guarded by veele, and therefore she so
often escapes the hunter. In some parts of Serbia and throughout
Montenegro it is a sin to kill a fox, or a bee.</p>
<p>The worship of certain snakes is common throughout the Balkans. In
Montenegro the people believe that a black snake lives in a hole under
every house, and if anybody should kill it, the head of the house is
sure to die. Certain water-snakes with fiery heads were also considered
of the same importance as the evil dragons (or hydra) who, at one time,
threatened ships sailing on the Lake of Scutari. One of these hydras is
still supposed to live in the Lake of Rikavatz, in the deserted
mountains of Eastern Montenegro, from the bottom of which the hidden
monster rises out of the water from time to time, and returns heralded
by great peals of thunder and flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>But the Southern Slavs do not represent the dragon as the Hellenes
did, that is to say as a monster in the form of a huge lizard or
serpent, with crested head, wings and great strong claws, for they know
this outward form is merely used as a misleading mask. In his true
character a dragon is a handsome youth, possessing superhuman strength
and courage, and he is usually represented as in love with some
beautiful princess or empress.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1628src"

mention of <i>tcharobnitzi</i> (enchanters), who are known to have
lived also in Russia, where, during the eleventh century, they sapped
the new Christianity. The Slavonic translation of the Gospel recognized
by the Church in the ninth century applies the name
&lsquo;tcharobnitzi&rsquo; to the three Holy Kings.</p>
<p>To this same category belong the <i>resnitzi</i> who, as is apparent
in the Emperor Doushan&rsquo;s Code referred to previously, used to
burn the bodies of the dead. <i>Resnik</i>, which appears as a proper
name in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, means, according to all evidence,
&ldquo;the one who is searching for truth.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1650" class="main">Sacrificial Rites</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From translations of the Greek legends of the saints,
the exact terminology of the sacrificial ceremonies and the places
where they had been made is well known. Procopius mentions oxen as the
animals generally offered for sacrifice, but we find that calves,
goats, and sheep, in addition to oxen, were used by the Polapic Slavs
and Lithuanians, and that, according to Byzantine authorities, the
Russians used even birds as well. In Montenegro, on the occasion of
raising a new building, a ram or a cock is usually slaughtered in order
that a corner-stone may be besprinkled with its blood, and, at the
ceremony of inaugurating a new fountain, a goat is killed. Tradition
tells of how Prince Ivan Tzrnoyevitch once shot in front of a cavern an
uncommonly big wild goat that, being quite wet, shook water from its
coat so that instantly a river began to flow thence. This stream is
called even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>now the River of Tzrnoyevitch. The story reminds
one of the goats&rsquo; horns and bodies of goats which are seen on the
altar dedicated to the Illyrian god, Bind, near a fountain in the
province of Yapod.</p>
<p>It is a fact that Russians and Polapic Slavs used to offer human
sacrifices. Mention of such sacrifices among the Southern Slavs is
found only in the cycle of myths relating to certain buildings, which,
it was superstitiously believed, could be completed only if a living
human being were buried or immured. Such legends exist among the
Serbians and Montenegrins concerning the building of the fortress
Skadar (Scutari) and the bridge near Vishegrad; with the Bulgarians in
reference to building the fort Lidga-Hyssar, near Plovdiv, and the
<i>Kadi-K&ouml;pri</i> (Turkish for &lsquo;the bridge of the
judge&rsquo;) on the river Struma; and again among modern Greeks in
their history of the bridge on the river Arta, and the Roumanians of
the church &lsquo;Curtea de Ardyesh.&rsquo; It seems very likely that
certain enigmatic bas-reliefs, representing oval human faces with just
the eyes, nose and mouth, which are found concealed under the cemented
surface of the walls of old buildings have some connexion with the
sacrificial practice referred to. There are three such heads in the
fortress of Prince Dyouragy Brankovitch at Smederevo (Semendria), not
far from Belgrade, on the inner side of the middle donjon fronting the
Danube, and two others in the monastery Rila on the exterior wall close
to the Doupitchka Kapiya.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1662" class="main">Funeral Customs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the siege of Constantinople in the year 626,
the Southern Slavs burnt the bodies of their dead. The Russians did the
same during the battles near Silistria, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>971, and subsequently
commemorative services were held in all parts of Russia, and the
remains of the dead were buried.</p>
<p>The Slavs of north Russia used to keep the ashes of the dead in a
small vessel, which they would place on a pillar by the side of a
public road; that custom persisted with the Vyatitchs of southern
Russia as late as 1100.</p>
<p>These funeral customs have been retained longest by the Lithuanians;
the last recorded instance of a pagan burial was when Keystut, brother
of the Grand Duke Olgerd, was interred in the year 1382, that is to
say, he was burnt together with his horses and arms, falcons and
hounds.</p>
<p>There are in existence upright stones, mostly heavy slabs of stone,
many of them broken, or square blocks and even columns, which were
called in the Middle Ages <i>kami</i>, or <i>bileg</i>, and now
<i>stetyak</i> or <i>mramor</i>. Such stones are to be found in large
numbers close together; for example, there are over 6000 in the
province of Vlassenitza, and some 22,000 in the whole of Herzegovina;
some can be seen also in Dalmatia, for instance, in Kanovli, and in
Montenegro, at Nikshitch; in Serbia, however, they are found only in
Podrigne. These stones are usually decorated with figures, which appear
to be primitive imitations of the work of Roman sculptors: arcades on
columns, plant designs, trees, swords and shields, figures of warriors
carrying their bows, horsemen, deer, bears, wild-boars, and falcons;
there are also oblong representations of male and female figures
dancing together and playing games.</p>
<p>The symbol of the Cross indicates the presence of Christianity.
Inscriptions appear only after the eleventh century. But many
tombstones plainly had their origin in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>the Middle Ages. Some
tombs, situated far from villages, are described by man&rsquo;s
personal name in the chronicles relating to the demarcations of
territories, for example, Bolestino Groblye (the cemetery of Bolestino)
near Ipek; Druzetin Grob (the tomb of Druzet). In Konavla, near Ragusa,
there was in the year 1420 a certain point where important cross-roads
met, known as &lsquo;Obugonov Grob.&rsquo; Even in our day there is a
tombstone here without inscription, called &lsquo;Obugagn Greb.&rsquo;
It is the grave of the Governor Obuganitch, a descendant of the family
of Lyoubibratitch, famous in the fourteenth century.</p>

Influence</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When paganism had disappeared, the Southern-Slavonic
legends received many elements from the Greeks and Romans. There are
references to the Emperors Trajan and Diocletian as well as to mythical
personages. In the Balkans, Trajan is often confused with the Greek
king Midas. In the year 1433 Chevalier Bertrandon de la
Broqui&egrave;re heard from the Greeks at Trajanople that this city had
been built by the Emperor Trajan, who had goat&rsquo;s ears. The
historian Tzetzes also mentions that emperor&rsquo;s goat&rsquo;s ears
<span class="trans" title="&#333;tia tragou"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#8032;&tau;&#8055;&alpha;
&tau;&rho;&#8049;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;</span></span>. In Serbian
legends the Emperor Trajan seems also to be confused with
D&aelig;dalus, for he is given war-wings in addition to the ears.</p>
<p>To the cycle of medi&aelig;val myths we owe also the <i>djins</i>
(giants) who dwelt in caverns, and who are known by the Turkish name
<i>div</i>&mdash;originally Persian. Notable of the <i>divs</i> were
those having only one eye&mdash;who may be called a variety of
cyclops&mdash;mentioned also in Bulgarian, Croatian and Slovenian
mythology. On the shores of the river Moratcha, in Montenegro, there is
a meadow called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=

which such creatures are said to have lived at one time.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e1717" class="main">The Spread of Christianity</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the pagan Slavs occupied the Roman provinces, the
Christian region was limited to parts of the Byzantine provinces. In
Dalmatia after the fall of Salona, the archbishopric of Salona was
transferred to Spalato (Splyet), but in the papal bulls of the ninth
century it continued always to be styled <i>Salonitana ecclesia</i>,
and it claimed jurisdiction over the entire lands as far as the
Danube.</p>
<p>According to Constantine Porphyrogenete, the Serbians adopted the
Christian faith at two different periods, first during the reign of the
Emperor Heraclius, who had requested the Pope to send a number of
priests to convert those peoples to the Christian faith. It is well
known, however, that the Slavs in Dalmatia even during the reign of
Pope John IV<a id="xd19e1726" name="xd19e1726"></a> (640&ndash;642)
remained pagans. No doubt Christianity spread gradually from the Roman
cities of Dalmatia to the various Slav provinces. The Croatians already
belonged to the Roman Church at the time when its priests were
converting the Serbians to Christianity between the years 642 and 731,
<i>i.e.</i>, after the death of Pope John IV<a id="xd19e1731" name=
"xd19e1731"></a> and before Leon of Isauria had broken off his
relations with Rome.</p>
<p>The second conversion of those of the Southern Slavs who had
remained pagans was effected, about 879, by the Emperor Basil I.</p>
<p>At first the Christian faith spread amongst the Southern Slavs only
superficially, because the people could not understand Latin prayers
and ecclesiastical books. It took root much more firmly and rapidly
when the ancient Slavonic language was used in the church services.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>Owing to the differences arising over icons and the form their
worship should take, enthusiasm for the conversion of the pagans by the
Latin Church considerably lessened. In the Byzantine provinces,
however, there was no need for a special effort to be made to the
people, for the Slavs came in constant contact with the Greek
Christians, whose beliefs they adopted spontaneously.</p>
<p>From the Slavonic appellations of places appearing in certain
official lists, one can see that new episcopates were established
exclusively for the Slavs by the Greek Church. The bishops conducted
their services in Greek, but the priests and monks, who were born
Slavs, preached and instructed the people in their own languages. Thus
they prepared the ground for the great Slav apostles.</p>
<p>The Slav apostles of Salonica, Cyrillos and his elder brother
Methodius, were very learned men and philosophers. The principal of the
two, Cyrillos, was a priest and the librarian of the Patriarchate; in
addition he was a professor of philosophy in the University of the
Imperial Palace at Constantinople, and he was much esteemed on account
of his ecclesiastical erudition. Their great work began in 862 with the
mission to the Emperor Michel III., with which the Moravian Princes
Rastislav and Svetopluk entrusted them.</p>
<p>The Moravians were already converted to Christianity, but they
wished to have teachers among them acquainted with the Slav language.
Before the brothers started on their journey, Cyrillos composed the
Slav alphabet and translated the Gospel.</p>
<p>Thus the Serbians obtained these Holy Books written in a language
familiar to them, and the doctrines of the great Master gradually, but
steadily, ousted the old, primitive religion which had taken the form
of pure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>Naturalism. But the worship of Nature could not
completely disappear, and has not, even to our day, vanished from the
popular creed of the Balkans. The folk-lore of those nations embodies
an abundance of religious and superstitious sentiment and rites handed
down from pre-Christian times, for after many years&rsquo; struggle
paganism was only partially abolished by the ritual of the Latin and
afterwards of the Greek Christian Church, to which all Serbians,
including the natives of Montenegro, Macedonia and parts of Bosnia,
belong.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1751" class="main">Superstition</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The foundations of the Christian faith were never laid
properly in the Balkans owing to the lack of cultured priests, and this
reason, and the fact that the people love to cling to their old
traditions, probably accounts for religion having never taken a very
deep hold on them. Even to this day superstition is often stronger than
religion, or sometimes replaces it altogether. The whole daily life of
the Southern Slav is interwoven with all kinds of superstition. He is
superstitious about the manner in which he rises in the morning and as
to what he sees first; for instance, if he sees a monk, he is sure to
have an unfortunate day; when he builds a house, a &lsquo;lucky
spot&rsquo; must be found for its foundation. At night he is
superstitious about the way he lies down; he listens to hear if the
cocks crow in time, and if the dogs bark much, and how they are
barking. He pays great attention to the moment when thunder is first
heard, what kind of rain falls, how the stars shine&mdash;whether or
not they shine at all, and looks anxiously to see if the moon has a
halo, and if the sun shines through a cloud. All these things are
portents and omens to his superstitious mind, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>and they
play a considerable part in all his actions. When he intends to join a
hunting expedition, for example, he decides from them whether there
will be game or not; he believes that he is sure to shoot something if
his wife, or sister (or any other good-natured person) jumps over his
gun before he calls up his dogs. Especially there are numberless
superstitions connected with husbandry, for some of which fairly
plausible explanations could be given; for others, however,
explanations are hopelessly unavailing, and the reasons for their
origin are totally forgotten. Nevertheless, all superstitions are
zealously observed because, the people say, &ldquo;it is well to do
so,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our ancestors always did so and were happy, why
should we not do the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The planting of fruit-trees and the growing of fruit must be aided
by charms, and numerous feasts are organized to secure a fruitful year,
or to prevent floods, hail, drought, frost, and other disasters. But
undoubtedly the greatest number of superstitions exist regarding the
daily customs, most of which refer to birth, marriage and death. Charms
are used to discover a future bridegroom or bride; to make a young man
fall in love with a maid or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>; also, if it seems
desirable, to make them hate each other. Sorcery is resorted to to
ensure the fulfilment of the bride&rsquo;s wishes with regard to
children; their number and sex are decided upon, their health is
ensured in advance, favourable conditions are arranged for their
appearance. Death can come, it is believed, only when the Archangel
Michael removes a soul from its body, and that can only happen on the
appointed day.</p>

<p>The chief national customs of the Southern Slavs are involved in a
mass of superstition. As the Serbians are the most representative of
the Balkan Slavs, we shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=

order to show how little of the true spirit of religion is to be found
in some of their religious observances.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1772" class="main">Marriage</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a child is born in a Serbian family, the friends
congratulate the parents and wish for them: &ldquo;that they may live
to see the green wreaths,&rdquo; which means living to see their child
married. Marriages are most frequent in autumn, especially towards
Christmas, and more rare in summer. When parents intend to find a
bridegroom for their daughter or a bride for their son, they generally
consider the question thoroughly for a whole year beforehand. They take
their daughter or son to various social gatherings, in order that they
may meet one suited to become the husband of their daughter or the wife
of their son. When a daughter is informed of her parents&rsquo;
decision she must hasten her preparations: she must see that the
<i>bochtchaluks</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e1778src" href=
"#xd19e1778" name="xd19e1778src">9</a> (wedding presents) which she has
to distribute among the wedding guests (<i>svati</i> or <i>svatovi</i>)
be finished soon. These presents are articles mostly made by her own
hands, such as socks, stockings, shirts, towels, and rugs. Usually the
house is put into good order and perhaps enlarged before the marriage,
and when all the preparations are ready the rumour of her approaching
marriage is allowed to spread through the village. As marriages are
usually settled by the parents, love-matches, unfortunately, are rare,
and elopements are regarded as phenomenal. There are, however, cases
where young people are not docile to the will of their parents with
regard to marriage. If a girl has fallen in love with a young man, she
may have recourse, besides usual ways and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>methods, to professional
enchantresses. Among the devices recommended by these friends of lovers
are the following: The maiden looks through the muzzle of a roast
sucking-pig (which has been killed for the Christmas festivities) at
her beloved, whereupon he is sure to grow madly in love with her; her
lover is bound to die of love for her if she sees him through a hole
made in a cherry or certain other fruit; she is equally sure to gain
his affection if she can succeed in finding the trace of his right
foot-print and turns the earth under it. These and many other kinds of
sorcery are usually practised on or about St. George&rsquo;s Day (23rd
of April, O.S.).</p>
<p>Young men, too, have recourse on occasion to witchcraft when they
desire the love of some obdurate maiden. For instance, if at midnight
on a certain Friday the young man goes to the courtyard of the dwelling
of the lady of his heart and there shakes a tree three times, uttering
as many times her Christian name, she is absolutely certain to answer
his call and to reciprocate his love. Another equally infallible method
is for him to catch a certain fish and to let it die near his heart;
then to roast its flesh until it is burnt to a cinder, then to pound
this, and to place the powder secretly in water or some other beverage.
If the girl can be induced to taste of it, she is as a matter of course
constrained to love him. These expedients recall the famous exploit of
the French troubadour Pierre Vidal undertaken to win the love of his
beautiful patroness Donna Azalais de Baux. A magical recipe for success
in love, taken from an Arabic monument, was given to the poet by Hugues
de Baux, a mischievous young knight and brother-in-law of the fair
Donna Azalais; the credulous Vidal was induced to ride on a pig one
moonlight night three times round the castle of his lady-love, all
unconscious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>that his waggish friend had brought all the
inmates to a terrace to witness his ridiculous exhibition.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1794" class="main">Marriage Negotiations</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When parents have chosen their son&rsquo;s bride they
send to her parents a fully qualified delegate (<i lang=
"sr">navodagjya</i>) to inquire whether or not they would consent to
give their daughter to the young man. As marriages are rarely concluded
without the aid of these delegates there are numerous persons who make
it their regular profession to negotiate marriages, and they receive a
sum of money when their offices are successful. In addition to this fee
the navodagjya receives from the future bride at least one pair of
socks. If the father of the girl is not agreeable to the proposal, he
generally does not give a decisive reply, but finds some pretext,
stating, for example, that his daughter is still too young, or that she
is not quite ready with her preparations for marriage; but if the young
man appears to be eligible and the father is willing to give his
consent, he generally answers that he would like to see his daughter
married to such an excellent man, provided the couple be fond of each
other. Then a meeting is arranged, although in fact this is merely a
matter of form, since the final decision must come from the parents
themselves, irrespective of the mutual feelings of the prospective
husband and wife. The parents ask the young people if they like one
another; usually an affirmative answer is given, whereupon all present
embrace each other, and presents are exchanged, both between the
parents and between the future husband and bride. This event is often
celebrated by the firing of pistols and guns, in order to make it known
all over the village that marriage festivities are soon to follow. Soon
after the ceremony, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>which may be called a preliminary betrothal,
the parents of the bridegroom, together with the young man and a few
most intimate friends, pay an official visit to the house of the bride.
The visit usually takes place in the evening, and, after the bridegroom
has given the bride a ring, festivities begin and last until the next
morning. A few days later the bride and the bridegroom go to church,
accompanied by a few friends, and the priest asks them some stereotyped
questions, such as: &ldquo;Do you wish to marry of your own free
will?&rdquo; to which they are, so to speak, compelled to answer
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1804" class="main">The Wedding Procession</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A week before the wedding-day both families prepare
their houses for numerous guests, whom they will entertain most
hospitably for several days. Until very recent times, if the bride
lived in some distant village the wedding procession had to travel for
several days to fetch her, and, in the absence of good roads for
carriages, the entire party had to ride on horseback. The wedding party
includes the <i>dever</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e1810src" href=
"#xd19e1810" name="xd19e1810src">10</a> (that is, leader of the bride),
who remains in constant attendance upon the bride throughout the
ceremonies, being, in a sense, her guardian; the <i>koom</i> (principal
witness, who in due course becomes a sort of sponsor or godfather to
the children); and the <i>stari-svat</i>, who is the second witness of
the wedding ceremony. Throughout the wedding ceremonies the koom has to
stand behind the bridegroom and the stari-svat behind the bride. The
stari-svat is also a kind of master of the ceremonies on the
wedding-day; he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>keeps order among the guests and presides at the
nuptial banquets. With the dever come also his parents, and the koom
and stari-svat must bring one servant each, to attend them during the
ceremony. These two witnesses must provide themselves with two large
wax candles, generally adorned with transparent silk lace and flowers,
which they must present to the bride in addition to many other
gifts.</p>
<p>Before the procession sets out, the young people fire pistols, sing,
and dance, whilst the elders sit and take refreshment. The appearance
of the bridegroom in his bridal garments, and wearing flowers in his
hat, is the signal for the traditional nuptial songs from a chorus of
girls. When the carriages are ready to start they sing the
following:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A falcon flew from the castle</p>
<p class="line">Bearing a letter under its wing,</p>
<p class="line">Drops the letter on the father&rsquo;s knee</p>
<p class="line">See! Father! The letter tells you</p>
<p class="line">That thy son will travel far,</p>
<p class="line">Beyond many running rivers,</p>
<p class="line">Through many verdant forests,</p>
<p class="line">Till he brings you a daughter[-in-law].&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The <i>Tzigan</i> (Gipsy) band begins its joyful
melodies; the bridegroom, the standard-bearer, and other young people
mount their horses, all gaily bedecked with flowers, and the procession
starts for the bride&rsquo;s house, the equestrians riding, generally,
two and two, firing pistols and singing. The procession is always led
by a frolicsome youth who carries a <i>tchoutoura</i> (a flat wooden
vessel) containing red wine. It is his duty to offer this to every
person the wedding party may meet on the road, and he is privileged to
make, during the wedding festival, jokes and witticisms at the expense
of everybody. He enjoys the licence of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>court jester for that
day, and nobody must resent his witticisms, which are, at times,
indelicate and coarse.</p>
<p>A few steps behind the tchoutoura-bearer ride the <i>voivode</i>
(general, or leader), whose office it is to support the former in his
sallies, and the standard-bearer, who carries the national flag; after
them, in one of the carriages profusely decorated with flowers, ride
the bridesmaids, who are selected from among the relatives of the
bridegroom. With other presents the maidens carry the wedding dress and
flowers which the bridegroom&rsquo;s father has bought for his future
daughter-in-law. Immediately following the bridesmaids rides the
bridegroom between the koom and the stari-svat. Then come other
relatives and guests, two and two in procession. At times these wedding
processions offer a very impressive sight.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e1856" class="main">The Arrival</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the wedding procession approaches the house of
the bride, its arrival is announced by firing off pistols and guns,
whereupon a number of girls appear and sing various songs expressive of
sorrow at the bride&rsquo;s departure from her old home. In some parts
of Serbia there still survives a strange old custom; the bride&rsquo;s
father requires that certain conditions should be fulfilled before the
gates of the courtyard are opened for the procession. For example, he
sends a good wrestler to challenge any or every man of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party, and one of the wedding guests must overpower
the challenger before the gates are opened. Of course, the wrestling
bout is not serious, as a rule. Another condition, obtaining in ether
parts, is that the newcomers are not be to admitted before one of them,
by firing his pistol, has destroyed a pot or other terra-cotta vessel
fastened at the top of the chimney. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>When such, or other, conditions have been successfully negotiated,
the wedding party is admitted to the house and led to tables loaded
with roast lamb or pork, cakes, fruit, wine and brandy. The
bride&rsquo;s father places the father of the bridegroom in the seat of
honour, and immediately next to him the stari-svat, then the koom and
then the bridegroom. When the guests are seated, a large flat cake
(<i>pogatcha</i>) is placed before the bridegroom&rsquo;s father, and
he lays upon it some gold coins; it may be a whole chain made of golden
ducats, which the bride is to wear later round her neck. His example is
followed immediately by the stari-svat, the koom, and all the other
guests. Finally the bride&rsquo;s father brings the dowry which he has
determined to give to his daughter and lays it on the cake. All the
money thus collected is handed over to the stari-svat, who will give it
in due course to the bride. Next the bridesmaids take the wedding dress
to the bride&rsquo;s apartment, where they adorn her with great care
and ceremony. Her toilet finished, one of her brothers, or, in the
absence of a brother, one of her nearest male relatives, takes her by
the hand and leads her to the assembled family and friends. The moment
she appears, the wedding guests greet her with a lively fire from their
pistols, and the bridesmaids conduct her to the bridegroom, to whom she
presents a wreath of flowers. She is then led to the stari-svat and the
koom, whose hands she kisses. That ordeal concluded, she goes into the
house, where, in front of the hearth, sit her parents on low wooden
chairs. There she prostrates herself, kissing the floor in front of the
fire. This is obviously a relic of fire-worship; now, however,
symbolical of the veneration of the centre of family life. When she
rises, the maiden kisses the hands of her father <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>and
mother, who, embracing her, give her their blessing. Now her brother,
or relative&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;escorts her back to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party and there delivers her formally to the dever,
who from that moment takes charge of her, in the first place presenting
to her the gifts he has brought.</p>

<div id="xd19e1869" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e1870" class="main">The Return from Church</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After they have feasted the guests mount their horses
and, firing tirelessly their pistols, set out with the bride for the
nearest church. When the religious ceremony is over the wedding party
returns to the bridegroom&rsquo;s home, and the bride has to alight
from her horse (or carriage) upon a sack of oats. While the others
enter the courtyard through the principal gate, the bride usually
selects some other entrance, for she fears lest she may be bewitched.
Immediately she enters, the members of the bridegroom&rsquo;s family
bring to her a vessel filled with various kinds of corn, which she
pours out on the ground &ldquo;in order that the year may be
fruitful.&rdquo; Next they bring her a male child whom she kisses and
raises aloft three times. She then passes into the house holding under
her arms loaves of bread, and in her hands bottles of red
wine&mdash;emblems of wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>Although the wedding guests have been well feasted at the
bride&rsquo;s house, the journey has renewed their appetites, therefore
they seat themselves at tables in the same order as we have already
seen, and are regaled with a grand banquet. Throughout the meal, as at
the previous one, the voivodes and the tchoutoura-bearer poke fun and
satire at the expense of everybody. These mirthful effusions are, as we
have already said, not generally in very good taste, but no one takes
offence, and everybody <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>laughs heartily, provided there be wit in the
jokes. After this feast, during which the young people perform the
national dances (<i>kollo</i>) and sing the traditional wedding songs,
the dever brings the bride to the threshold of her apartment
(<i>vayat</i>) and delivers her to the koom, who, in his turn, leads
her in, places her hand in that of the bridegroom and leaves them
alone. The guests, however, often remain in the house, until dawn,
drinking and singing.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1885" class="main">Slava (or Krsno Ime)</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This custom is considered to be a survival of the
times when the Serbians were first converted to Christianity. Every
Serbian family has one day in the year, known as <i>slava</i>,
generally some saint&rsquo;s day, when there are performed certain
ceremonies partly of a religious and partly of a social character. The
saint whom the head of the family celebrates as his patron, or tutelary
saint, is also celebrated by his children and their descendants.</p>
<p>A few days before the celebration the priest comes to the house of
every <i>svetchar</i>&mdash;the man who as the chief of the family
celebrates the saint&mdash;in order to bless the water which has been
prepared beforehand for that purpose in a special vessel; after this he
besprinkles the heads of all the members of the family with the holy
water, into which he has dipped a small sprig of basil. Then he
proceeds from room to room performing the same ceremony in each.</p>
<p>In order to please their tutelary saint, all the members of the
family fast for at least a week before the feast. On the eve of the
saint&rsquo;s day a taper is lit before the saint&rsquo;s image, and
remains burning for two days. One or two days before the festival the
women prepare a <i>kolatch</i> (a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>special cake made of
wheat-flour) which measures about fifteen inches in diameter, and is
about three inches thick. Its surface is divided into quarters by being
marked with a cross, each quarter bearing a shield with the letters
I.N.R.I. In the centre there is a circle in which is a <i>poskurnik</i>
(monogram of these initials). Besides the kolatch, another cake of
white wheat well boiled and mixed with powdered sugar, chopped nuts,
and almonds, is made. This is called <i>kolyivo</i> (literally
&ldquo;something which has been killed with the knife&rdquo;). This is
obviously a relic of the pagan times when kolyivo was the name given to
animals sacrificed on the altar. When the Serbians were converted to
the Christian faith, they were told that the Christian God and His
saints did not call for animal, and still less for human sacrifice, and
that boiled wheat might serve as a substitute. And it is interesting to
find that kolyivo is prepared only for those saints whom the people
believe to be dead, and not for those who are believed to be still
living, such as St. Elias (Elijah), the patron Saint of Thunder, or the
&ldquo;Thunderer,&rdquo; the Archangel Michael and certain others, for
it is emphatically a symbolic offering for the dead.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1911" class="main">The Slava Eve Reception</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the eve of the Slava day enough food is prepared to
last for the two following days, and toward sunset, all the tables are
well loaded with refreshments in readiness for the arrival of numerous
guests. Friends and relations are invited to come by a messenger
especially sent out from the house. There are several stereotyped forms
of this invitation, one of which is the following: &ldquo;My father (or
my uncle, as the case may be) has sent me to bring you his greetings
and to invite you to our house this evening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>to drink
a glass of brandy. We wish to share with you the blessings bestowed
upon us by God, and our patron-saint. We entreat you to come!&rdquo; At
these words the messenger hands to the invited guest a tchoutoura
filled with red wine and decorated with flowers, out of which the guest
is obliged to take a little. He then makes the sign of the Cross, and
says: &ldquo;I thank you, and may your Slava be a happy and prosperous
one!&rdquo; After tasting the wine, he continues: &ldquo;We will do our
best to come. It is simple to comply with your wish, since we are
invited to share such an honour.&rdquo; He invariably pronounces these
words whether he really intends to accept the invitation or not.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while the messenger was away inviting guests, the
women of the household have been making all the preparations necessary
for their reception. Each guest, as he reaches the threshold exclaims:
&ldquo;O master of the house, art thou willing to receive
guests?&rdquo; Hearing this the Svetchar rushes to meet the guest and
greets him in these words: &ldquo;Certainly I am, and may there be many
more good guests such as thou art!&rdquo; Then the guest enters,
embraces the Svetchar and says: &ldquo;I wish thee a most pleasant
evening and a happy Slava!&rdquo; And then as a matter of course the
host answers: &ldquo;I thank thee, and welcome thee to my house!&rdquo;
In the same manner the other guests are greeted. When they have all
arrived, the host invites them to wash their hands&mdash;for no Serbian
peasant would ever sit down to take food without first doing so. Then
the host shows to each one his place at the table, always strictly
observing precedence due to seniority.</p>
<p>The girls of the house first pass round brandy to the assembled
guests and this, at least in the winter, has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>generally been warmed, and honey or sugar has been
added. While that is being served all the guests stand, and in silence
wait reverently for the ceremonies of the Slava to begin.</p>
<p>The host places in the middle of the table a large wax candle, which
he does not light until he has made the sign of the Cross three times.
Next he takes an earthen vessel containing a few embers, places in it a
few small pieces of incense and then lets the fragrance ascend to the
icon, which is, according to custom, occupying the place of honour in
the room, then still holding the censer he stops for a few moments
before each guest. That ceremony being ended, and if there be no priest
present, the host himself invites his guests to say their prayers to
themselves. A great many Serbian peasants are gifted with the power of
offering extempore prayers and they are always in request at these
ceremonies. The host passes the censer to his wife, whose duty it is to
see that the fumes of the incense reach into every part of the house.
Next the host breaks silence with the following prayer: &ldquo;Let us
pray, O brethren, most reverently to the Almighty Lord, our God, and to
the Holy Trinity! O Lord, Thou omnipotent and gracious Creator of
Heaven and Earth, deliver us, we pray Thee, from all unforeseen evil!
O, St. George! (here he adds the name of the saint whose festival they
are celebrating), our holy patron-saint, protect us and plead for us
with the Lord, our God, we here gathered together do pray Thee. Ye Holy
Apostles, ye, the four Evangelists and pillars upon whom rest the
Heavens and the Earth, we, being sinners, do conjure ye to intercede
for us,&rdquo; and so on. When his prayer is finished, the guests make
the sign of the Cross several times and then supper begins.

<h3 id="xd19e1928" class="main">Slava Toasts</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the first two or three courses, the guests
continue to drink brandy, and wine is not served until they have
partaken of meat. At the drinking of the first glass of wine the oldest
guest or whoever enjoys the highest dignity of position (generally it
is the village priest or the mayor) proposes the first toast, of
which&mdash;as well as of all the subsequent ones&mdash;it may be said
that tradition has ordered the exact programme to be followed in all
these proceedings, and even prescribed the very words to be used. In
some parts of Serbia the host himself proposes the first toast to the
most distinguished of his guests, addressing him with: &ldquo;I beg to
thank you, as well as all your brethren, for the honour which you
graciously show me in coming to my Slava! Let us drink the first glass
to the glory of the gracious God! Where wine is drunk in His name, may
prosperity always be!&rdquo; The principal guest accepts the toast,
makes the sign of the Cross and answers in such words as the following:
&ldquo;I thank you, most kind and hospitable host! May your Slava bring
you prosperity, let us drink this second glass &lsquo;for the better
hour.&rsquo;&rdquo; The third toast is generally &ldquo;To the glory of
the Holy Trinity!&rdquo; (In Serbian: <i lang="sr">Tretya-sretya, sve u
slavu Svete Troyitze!</i>)</p>
<p>In some parts of Serbia there are commonly seven or even more toasts
to be drunk, but this custom shows, fortunately, a tendency to
disappear.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1938" class="main">The Ceremony at Church</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next morning all the members of the family rise very
early in order to restore order in the house, and the Svetchar goes to
the nearest church, taking with him the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>kolyivo, the kolatch,
some wine, incense and a wax candle. All these things he places in
front of the altar where they must remain during the morning service,
after which the officiating priest cuts the Slava cake from underneath
so that his cuts correspond with the lines of the cross shown on the
upper surface. Then he breaks the cake and turns it in a circle with
the help of the Svetchar, while they pronounce certain prayers
together. This ceremony ended, the host takes one half of the cake home
and leaves the other half to the priest. If it happens that the church
is far away, and time does not allow the host to absent himself long
from home, the Slava cake may be cut in halves by him in his own house
with the help of his male guests, chanting all the while certain formal
prayers: and standing in a circle they hold the cake so that a thumb of
each guest should be placed on the top of the cake, whilst they each
support it with four fingers.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Toward noon, a few minutes before the sun reaches his
zenith, a part of the Slava cake is placed upon the table together with
a lighted wax candle. To this midday meal many more guests are usually
invited than had attended the supper on the previous evening;
furthermore, on this day even a stranger&mdash;whatever his religion
may be&mdash;has the right to enter the house and to claim hospitality.
For instance, the Royal Prince Marko had many friends amongst the
Turks, and they would invariably come to him as guests on his Slava
day. All the guests rise together, cross themselves with great
reverence, and, in perfect silence, with glasses filled, they await the
address to be made by the Svetchar. Again three, or perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>more, toasts are proposed and accepted, and, of
course, as many times are the glasses again emptied and re-filled
before the &lsquo;midday&rsquo; meal is even begun. Eating and
drinking, in all cases, &ldquo;to the glory of God, the Holy Trinity,
to the Holy Slava&rdquo; and so forth continue till late at night, when
the guests remember that it is time to go home. Many, however, remain
in the house all night and for the next day. Some devotees of good wine
used actually to remain, on occasions, for three whole consecutive days
and nights. This very extreme devotion to the saints has been practised
more especially at Nish, and in that neighbourhood, and has furnished
the celebrated Serbian novelist Stefan Strematz with abundant material
for one of the finest, as it is undoubtedly one of the wittiest, novels
that have been written in Serbian.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1952" class="main">Christmas Eve</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another festival, which the Serbians, like other
nations, conduct with many rites and customs of unmistakably pagan
origin and which fills the hearts of all with joy, is Christmas. It is
a saying of the Serbian people that &ldquo;there is no day without
light&mdash;neither is there any real joy without Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Serbian peasant is, as a general rule, an early riser, but on
Christmas Eve (<i>Badgni dan</i>) everybody is up earlier than usual,
for it is a day when each member of the household has his hands full of
work to be done. Two or more of the young men are sent out from every
house to the nearest forest<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1961src" href=
"#xd19e1961" name="xd19e1961src">11</a> to cut, and bring home, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>young oak tree, which is called <i>Badgnak</i>.
(The etymology of this word is obscure, but it is probably the name, or
derived from the name, of a pagan god.) When the young man who is to
cut the tree has selected it, he kneels down, and murmuring words of
greeting and uttering a special prayer, he throws at it a handful of
wheat or corn; then he makes the sign of the Cross three times and
begins carefully to cut in such a direction that the tree must
necessarily fall toward the East, and at just about the moment when the
sun first shows himself above the horizon. He has also to see that the
tree does not touch, in falling to earth, the branches of any tree near
it, otherwise the prosperity of his house would most surely be
disturbed during the ensuing year. The trunk of the tree is now cut
into three logs, one of which is rather longer than the others.</p>
<p>Toward evening, when everything is ready and all the members of the
family are assembled in the kitchen, the chief room in the dwelling, a
large fire is lit, and the head of the family solemnly carries in the
Badgnak, and, placing it on the fire, so that the thicker end is left
about twelve inches beyond the hearth, he pronounces in a loud voice
his good wishes for the prosperity of the house and all within it. In
the same way he brings in the other parts of the Badgnak, and, when all
are in a blaze, the young shepherds embrace across the largest log, for
they believe that by doing so they will ensure the attachment of the
sheep to their lambs, of the cows to their calves, and of all other
animals to their young.</p>
<p>At this point of the proceedings the oldest member of the family
brings in a bundle of straw and hands it over to the housewife, to whom
he wishes at the same time &ldquo;a good evening and a happy Badgni
dan.&rdquo; She then throws <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>a handful of corn at him, thanks him
for the straw and starts walking about the kitchen and the adjoining
rooms, scattering straw on the floor and imitating the clucking of
hens, while the children gleefully follow her and imitate the sounds
made by young chicks.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e1976width" id="p048"><img src="images/p048.jpg"
alt="The children gleefully follow her" width="494" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">The children gleefully follow her</p>
</div>
<p>This finished, the mother has next to bring a yellow wax candle and
an earthen vessel filled with burning coal. The father again reverently
makes the sign of the Cross, lights the candle and places some incense
on the embers. Meanwhile the rest of the family have already formed
themselves into a semi-circle, with the men standing on the right and
the women on the left. The father now proceeds to say prayers aloud,
walking from one end of the semi-circle to the other and stopping in
front of each person for a short space of time that the fumes of
smoking incense, in the censer, held in his right hand, should rise to
the face of every one in turn. The prayers which they utter on these
occasions last for about fifteen or twenty minutes, and vary in nearly
every district.</p>
<p>After the prayers they all sit down to supper, which is laid, not
upon a table, but on the floor, for it is considered a good orthodox
custom to lay sacks over the stone or clay of which the floor is
formed, and to use cushions instead of chairs, on Christmas Eve. During
supper, at which no meat is served, the father of the family
enthusiastically toasts the Badgnak, expressing at the same time his
wishes for their common prosperity for the new year, and pours a glass
of wine over the protruding end of the log. In many parts of Serbia all
the peasants&mdash;men, women, and even small children&mdash;fast for
the forty-five days immediately before Christmas. They abstain from
meat, eggs, and milk-food, and eat simply vegetables and fruit.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the supper is over the whole family retires to bed, except one
of the young men, who remains near the fire to see that the Badgnak
does not burn off completely, and that the fire is not
extinguished.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1988" class="main">Christmas Day</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is generally believed that the rites and customs
concerning this Church festival, which we Serbians call in our own
language <i>Bojitch</i>, meaning &lsquo;the little God,&rsquo; is
nothing but the modified worship of the pagan god Dabog (or Daybog), to
whom we have already referred, or perhaps represents several forms of
that worship. Our pagan ancestors used to sacrifice a pig to their
Sun-god, and in our day there is not a single house throughout Serbia
in which &ldquo;roast pork&rdquo; is not served on Christmas Day as a
matter of course. The men and boys of each household rise very early in
the morning that day to make a big fire in the courtyard, and to roast
a sucking-pig on a spit, for which all preparations are made on Badgni
dan. The moment each little pig is placed at the fire there is a
vigorous firing of pistols or rifles to greet it, showing by the sound
of shot after shot that the whole village is astir. As nearly all the
houses in a village practise the same custom most zealously, and as
naturally every youth considers it a part of his duty to fire a pistol,
the neighbouring hills echo again and again as if persistent
skirmishing were going on.</p>
<p>Still early in the morning one of the maidens goes to the public
well to fetch some drinking water, and when she reaches the well she
greets it, wishing it a happy Christmas, throwing at the same time into
it a handful of corn and a bunch, or perhaps merely a sprig, of basil.
She throws the corn in the hope that the crops may be as abundant as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>water, and the basil is to keep the water always
limpid and pure. The first cupful of the water she draws is used to
make a cake (<i>Thesnitza</i>) to be broken at the midday meal into as
many pieces as there are members of the household. A silver coin has
been put into the dough, and the person who finds it in his piece of
cake is considered as the favourite of fortune for the year to
come.</p>
<p>During the morning every house expects a visitor (<i>polaznik</i>),
who is usually a young boy from a neighbouring house. When the polaznik
enters the house he breaks off a small branch of the Badgnak&rsquo;s
smouldering end, and while he is greeting the head of the house with
&lsquo;Christ is born!&rsquo; and all the others are answering him with
a cry of &lsquo;In truth He is born!&rsquo; the mother throws at him a
handful of wheat. He then approaches the hearth, and strikes the
Badgnak with his own piece of tree repeatedly, so that thousands of
sparks fly up into the chimney, and he pronounces his good wishes:
&ldquo;May the holy Christmas bring to this house as many sheep, as
many horses, as many cows, as many beehives, [and so forth,] as there
are sparks in this fire!&rdquo; Then he places on the Badgnak either a
silver or a gold coin, which the head of the family keeps to give to
the blacksmith to smelt in with the steel when making his new
plough&mdash;for, as he believes, this cannot fail to make the ground
more fertile and all go well. The polaznik is, of course, made to stay
and share the meal with them, and afterwards he is presented with a
special cake also containing a coin, sometimes a gold one, sometimes
silver.</p>
<p>After the repast all the youths go out of doors for sports,
especially for sleighing, while the older people gather together around
a <i>gooslar</i> (a national bard), and take <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>much,
even endless, delight in listening to his recitals of their ancient
ballads.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2015" class="main">The Dodola Rite</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The disasters which Serbian peasants most fear are of
two kinds&mdash;drought and very violent storms. In pagan times there
was a goddess who, it is believed, ruled the waters and the rain. When
the Serbians were first converted to Christianity, the power of
controlling the ocean, rivers, and storms, and the sailing of ships at
sea, was attributed to St. Nicholas, and the Dalmatians, sea-going men,
still pray only to him; whereas in the heart of Serbia, where the
peasants have no conception of what large navigable rivers are, still
less of what seas and lakes are like, recourse is taken to the
favourite goddess <i>Doda</i> or <i>Dodola</i> whenever there is an
unduly long spell of dry weather.</p>
<p>The Dodola rite is a peculiar one. A maiden, generally a Gipsy, is
divested of her usual garments and then thickly wrapped round with
grass and flowers so that she is almost concealed beneath them. She
wears a wide wreath of willow branches interwoven with wild flowers
around her waist and hips, and in such fantastic attire she has to go
from house to house in the village dancing, while each housewife pours
over her a pailful of water, and her companions chant a prayer having
the refrain, <i>Oy Dodo, oy Dodole</i>, after every single line:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Fall, O rain! and gentlest dew!</p>
<p class="line xd19e2033">Oy, Dodo! Oy, Dodole!</p>

<p class="line xd19e2033">Oy, Dodo! Oy, Dodole!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In each verse that follows mention is made of a cereal
or other plant, imploring Doda that rain may soon be shed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>upon it.
Then the cottage women give them presents, either food or money, and
the maidens sing other songs for them, always in the same rhythm, give
their thanks, offer good wishes, and are gone.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2088" class="main">The Importance of the Ballads</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the Serbian people&mdash;as a distinct Slav and
Christian nationality&mdash;did not succumb altogether to the Ottoman
oppressor; that through nearly five centuries of subjection to the Turk
the Southern Slavs retained a deep consciousness of their national
ideals, is due in a very large measure to the Serbian national poetry,
which has kept alive in the hearts of the Balkan Christians deep hatred
of the Turk, and has given birth, among the oppressed Slavs, to the
sentiment of a common misfortune and led to the possibility of a
collective effort which issued in the defeat of the Turk on the
battlefields of Koumanovo, Monastir, Prilip, Prizrend, Kirk-Kilisse,
and Scutari.</p>
<p>Who has written those poems? We might as well ask, who is the author
of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>? If <i>Homer</i> be the
collective pseudonym of an entire cycle of Hellenic national bards,
&lsquo;The Serbian people&rsquo; is that of the national bards who
chanted those Serbian epic poems during the centuries, and to whom it
was nothing that their names should be attached to them. The task of
the learned Diascevastes of Pisistrate&rsquo;s epoch, which they
performed with such ability in the old Hellade, has been done in Serbia
by a self-taught peasant, the famous Vouk Stephanovitch-Karadgitch, in
the beginning of the nineteenth century. Vouk&rsquo;s first collection
of Serbian national poems, which he wrote down as he heard them from
the lips of the <i>gousslari</i> (i.e. Serbian national bards), was
published for the first time at Vienna in 1814, and was not only
eagerly read throughout Serbia and in the literary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>circles
of Austria and Germany, but also in other parts of Europe. Goethe
himself translated one of the ballads, and his example was quickly
followed by others.</p>
<p>Those poems&mdash;as may be seen from the examples given in this
volume&mdash;dwell upon the glory of the Serbian medi&aelig;val empire,
lost on the fatal field of Kossovo (1389). When the Turks conquered the
Serbian lands and drove away the flower of the Serbian aristocracy,
these men took refuge in the monasteries and villages, where the
Turkish horsemen never came. There they remained through centuries
undisturbed, inspired by the eloquence of the Serbian monks, who
considered it their sacred duty to preserve for the nation behind their
old walls the memory of ancient kings and tzars and of the glorious
past in which they flourished.</p>
<p>Professional bards went from one village to another, chanting in an
easy decasyllabic verse the exploits of Serbian heroes and
<i>Ha&iuml;dooks</i> (knight-brigands), who were the only check upon
the Turkish atrocities. The bards carried news of political and other
interesting events, often correct, sometimes more or less distorted,
and the gifted Serbians&mdash;for gifted they were and still
are&mdash;did not find it difficult to remember, and to repeat to
others, the stories thus brought to them in poetic form. As the rhythm
of the poems is easy, and as the national ballads have become
interwoven with the spirit of every true Serbian, it is not rare that a
peasant who has heard a poem but once can not only repeat it as he
heard it, but also improvise passages; nay, he can at times even
compose entire original ballads on the spur of inspirational
moments.</p>
<p>In Serbian Hungary there are schools in which the blind learn these
national ballads, and go from one fair to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>another to recite them
before the peasants who come from all Serbian lands. But this is not
the true method. In the mountains of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and
Herzegovina there is no occasion to learn them mechanically: they are
familiar to all from infancy. When, in the winter evening, the members
of a Serbian family assemble around the fire, and the women are engaged
with their spinning, poems are recited by those who happen to know them
best.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2120" class="main">The Goussle</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ballads are recited invariably to the
accompaniment of a primitive instrument with a single string, called a
<i>goussle</i>, which is to be met with in almost every house. The
popular Serbian poet, Peter Petrovitch, in his masterpiece, <i lang=
"sr">Gorsky Viyenatz</i> (&lsquo;The Mountain Wreath&rsquo;) uttered
the following lines, which have become proverbial:</p>
<div lang="sr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Dye se goussle u kutyi ne tchuyu</p>
<p class="line">Tu su mrtva i kutya i lyoudi.</p>

<p class="line">(The house in which the goussle is not heard</p>
<p class="line">Is dead, as well as the people in it.)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The old men, with grown-up sons, who are excused from
hard labour, recite to their grandchildren, who yield themselves with
delight to the rhythmic verse through which they receive their first
knowledge of the past. Even the abbots of the monasteries do not deem
it derogatory to recite those ballads and to accompany their voices by
the monotonous notes of the goussle. But the performance has more of
the character of a recitation than of singing: the string is struck
only at the end of each verse. In some parts of Serbia, however, each
syllable is accentuated by a stroke of the bow, and the final syllable
is somewhat prolonged. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>The heroic decasyllabic lines have invariably five trochees, with
the fixed c&aelig;sura after the second foot; and almost every line is
in itself a complete sentence.</p>
<p>There is hardly a tavern or inn in any Serbian village where one
could see an assembly of peasants without a gousslar, around whom all
are gathered, listening with delight to his recitals. At the festivals
near the cloisters, where the peasants meet together in great numbers,
professional gousslars recite the heroic songs and emphasize the
pathetic passages in such an expressive manner that there is hardly a
listener whose cheeks are not bedewed with copious tears. The music is
extremely simple, but its simplicity is a powerful and majestic
contrast to the exuberance of romance manifested in the exploits and
deeds of some favourite hero&mdash;as, for example, the Royal Prince
Marko.</p>
<p>There are many bold hyperboles in those national songs, and little
wonder if they are discredited by Western critics, especially in the
ballads concerning the exploits of the beloved Marko&mdash;who
&ldquo;throws his heavy mace aloft as high as the clouds and catches it
again in his right hand, without dismounting from his trusty courser
Sharatz.&rdquo; Now and then an English reader may find passages which
may seem somewhat coarse, but he must bear in mind that the ballads
have usually been composed and transmitted from generation to
generation by simple and illiterate peasants. Most of those concerning
the Royal Prince Marko date from the early fourteenth century, when the
customs, even in Western Europe, were different from those prevailing
now. My translations have, however, been carefully revised by Mrs. C.
H. Farnam, who has taken a great interest in this book, and has
endeavoured to do no injustice to the rugged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>originals. Having passed some time in
Serbia&mdash;as many noble English ladies have done&mdash;nursing the
wounded heroes of the Balkan War, of 1912&ndash;13, and softening their
pain with unspeakable tenderness and devotion, she was attracted by the
natural, innate sense of honesty and the bravery which her cultivated
mind discovered in those simple Serbians and her interest has since
extended to their history and literature.</p>
<p>It is worthy of consideration that the history of the Serbian and
other Southern Slavonic nations, developed by its poetry&mdash;if not
even replaced by it altogether&mdash;has through it been converted into
a national property, and is thus preserved in the memory of the entire
people so vividly that a Western traveller must be surprised when he
hears even the most ignorant Serbian peasant relate to him something at
least of the old kings and tsars of the glorious dynasty of Nemagnitch,
and of the feats and deeds of national heroes of all epochs.

<h3 id="xd19e2159" class="main">The Marko Legends</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marko was, as we have already seen, the son of King
Voukashin; and his mother was Queen Helen, whom the Serbian troubadours
called by the pleasing and poetic name Yevrossima (Euphrosyne) in their
songs and poems.</p>
<p>According to the popular tradition, the Prince was born in the
castle of Skadar (Scutari), and his mother, being the sister of that
most glorious and adventurous knight Momchilo, fortunately transmitted
much of the heroism, and many of the other virtues, characteristic of
her own family, to her son.</p>
<p>But there is also another tradition, equally popular, which
maintains that Marko was the child of a <i>veela</i> (fairy-queen) and
a <i>zmay</i> (dragon). The fact that his father was a dragon is
believed, by those who accept this tradition, to explain and in every
way to account for, Marko&rsquo;s tremendous strength and his
astonishing powers of endurance.</p>
<p>Truly Prince Marko possessed a striking and extraordinarily
attractive personality: he so vividly impressed the minds of the
Serbian people, people of all ranks and localities, that he has always
been, remains to this day, and promises ever to remain, our most
beloved hero. Indeed there is no Serbian to be found, even in the most
remote districts, who has not a great love for Kralyevitch Marko, and
who cannot tell his story.</p>
<p>This Prince&rsquo;s brave deeds and all his exploits have luckily
been immortalized by the national bards, who are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>never
weary of describing him in their ballads and legends as a lover of
justice, the hater of all oppression, and the avenger of every wrong.
He is always represented as the possessor of great physical strength:
his principal weapon was his heavy war-club (it weighed one hundred
pounds&mdash;sixty pounds of steel, thirty pounds of silver, and the
remainder was pure gold) and it must be borne in mind that the swords
and clubs wielded by the merely human hands of his antagonists can
never kill him; they never injure him, for they scarcely ever even
touch this hero. Marko is always thought to have had much of the
supernatural in him.</p>
<p>Marko, who was often rough and ready in his behaviour, and more
especially so to the Turks, whose very Sultan, indeed, he mightily
terrified with the tales he told of his many bloodthirsty and warlike
deeds, was invariably a most dutiful, loving and tender-hearted son to
his mother: and there were occasions when he willingly consulted her,
and followed the advice she gave him.</p>
<p>Prince Marko was fearless: It was said that &ldquo;he feared no one
but God&rdquo;; and it was his rule to be courteous to all women. In
Serbia it was the usual custom to drink a great deal of wine, the red
wine of which we so often hear, and this custom was one which Marko
upheld: but it is always said, and universally believed, that he was
never drunk.</p>
<p>The ballads also sing of King Voukashin. Voukashin had been the
Councillor of State during the reign of Doushan the Powerful. The
capital of the Empire was Prizrend, and Marko was brought up then at
the Court, by his father Voukashin. According to the generally accepted
belief it was Marko who, a little later on, attended the Emperor as
secretary and councillor of State, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>was entrusted by Doushan,
on the approach of death, with his young son Ourosh.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2188" class="main">The Bad Faith of Voukashin</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One ballad relates that the Emperor Doushan had
bequeathed the crown to Voukashin and stipulated in his will that that
monarch should reign for seven years, and at the end of that time he
should give up the rule to the Tsarevitch Ourosh. King Voukashin not
only prolonged his haughty rule to sixteen years, but absolutely
refused to yield the sceptre even then, and moreover proclaimed himself
sovereign Tsar. The ballad further depicts the incessant struggles
which were in the end to cause the downfall of the Serbian
medi&aelig;val State. And so tradition, earnestly sympathizing with the
just anger felt by the people against the rebels, and their lamentation
over the lost tsardom, charges Voukashin with all the blame and
responsibility&mdash;curses him as a usurper and a traitor, and
execrates him for his cunning and inconsistency: whilst on the other
hand tradition ever extols and glorifies his son Marko as the faithful
defender of Prince Ourosh, as the great avenger of national wrongs, and
praises him at all times for his good heart, his generous foresight in
politics and private affairs, his humanity, and above all his readiness
to perish in the cause of justice.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2193" class="main">The Horse Sharatz</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of Marko cannot be told without some account
of Sharatz, his much-loved piebald steed, from whom he was never
parted.</p>
<p>Sharatz was undoubtedly unique. There are several versions of the
story as to how Marko became possessed of him: Some of the bards assert
that Sharatz was given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"
name="pb62">62</a>]</span>to Marko by the same veela who had from the
first endowed him with his marvellous strength; but there are others
who affirm that Marko once bought a foal suffering from leprosy, and
that the Prince tended him himself and completely cured him, taught him
to drink wine, and finally made him the fine horse that he became.</p>
<p>And there are others again who say that at one time, in his youth,
Marko served a master for three years, and that for his sole reward he
asked permission to choose a horse from among those then grazing in the
meadow. His master gladly consented, and Marko, according to his
custom, tested each horse in turn, by taking it by the tail and
whirling it round and round.</p>
<p>At last, when he came to a certain piebald foal he seized it by the
tail: but this animal did not stir, and Marko, with all his vast
strength, could not make it move one step. Marko chose that foal, and
it became his beloved Sharatz. The Serbians of Veles still call a great
plain near Demir-Kapi &lsquo;Markova Livada&rsquo; (Marko&rsquo;s
meadow). Sharatz means &lsquo;piebald,&rsquo; and it is said that the
skin of Marko&rsquo;s horse was more like the hide of an ox in
appearance than like the skin of an ordinary horse. The Prince called
him by various endearing names, such as Sharin or Sharo, and was
devoted to him for the hundred and sixty years they were together.</p>
<p>This wonderful beast was the strongest and swiftest horse ever
known, and he often overtook the flying veela. He was so well trained
that he knew the very moment when to kneel down to save his master from
an adversary&rsquo;s lance; he knew just how to rear and strike the
adversary&rsquo;s charger with his fore-feet. When his spirit was
thoroughly roused Sharatz would spring up to the height of three
lengths of a lance and to the distance of four lance-lengths
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>forward; beneath his hoofs glittering sparks shone
forth, and the very earth he trod would crack and stones and fragments
fly in all directions; and his nostrils exhaled a quivering blue flame,
terrifying to all beholders. He often bit off the ears of
enemies&rsquo; horses and crushed and trampled to death numbers of
Turkish soldiers. Marko might peacefully doze, and sometimes even go to
sleep, when riding through the mountains; and all the time he was safe,
for Sharatz would keep careful guard. Therefore the Prince would feed
his steed, with bread and wine, from the vessels that he used himself
and loved him more than he loved his own brother; and Sharatz shared,
as he deserved to share, the glory of many a victory with his master.
Marko never rode upon another horse, and together they were described
as &ldquo;a dragon mounted upon a dragon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are in existence about thirty-eight poems and perhaps twice as
many prose-legends containing detailed descriptions of Marko&rsquo;s
thrilling exploits, and there is hardly a Serb or a Bulgar anywhere to
be found who cannot recite at least a few of them. In the
Balkans-Turkish War, 1912&ndash;13, a <i>gouslar</i>, when not
fighting, would take his <i><span class="corr" id="xd19e2215" title=
"Source: gousle">goussle</span></i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e2217src"
href="#xd19e2217" name="xd19e2217src">1</a> and recite to his comrades
heroic poems of which the greater number related to Marko. The intense
veneration felt by Serbians for this beloved Prince proves an unfailing
bond between them in their own country and in all parts of the
world.</p>
<p>There are, naturally enough, various accounts of the death of Marko.
The story that has most appealed to his countrymen and taken a
specially firm hold of their poets&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>imaginations is that he
never died. It is believed that he withdrew to a cave, near his castle
at Prilip, which is still standing, to rest, and that he is there, now,
asleep. From time to time he awakes and looks to see if his sword has
yet come out of a rock into which he had thrust it to the very hilt.
When the sword is out of the rock Marko will know that the time has
come for him to appear among the Serbians once more, to re-establish
the medi&aelig;val empire, lost at the battle of Kossovo.<a class=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=

<p>As for Sharatz, he is still feeding, but he has now nearly finished
his portion of hay.</p>

<p class="first">Four <i>tabors</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e2268src"
href="#xd19e2268" name="xd19e2268src">3</a> met together on the
beautiful field of Kossovo near the white church Samodrezja:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e2273src" href="#xd19e2273" name="xd19e2273src">4</a>
One tabor was headed by King Voukashin; the second by Despot
Ouglesha;<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2276src" href="#xd19e2276" name=
"xd19e2276src">5</a> the third by Vo&iuml;vode Goyko, and the fourth by
Tsarevitch Ourosh.</p>
<p>The first three of these were disputing over the inheritance of the
Empire and were ready to stab one another, so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>eager
were they all to reign. They did not know who had been appointed the
Tsar&rsquo;s successor and who was the rightful heir to the throne.
King Voukashin announced: &ldquo;The Empire was left to me!&rdquo;
Vo&iuml;vode Goyko cried out: &ldquo;Not so! The Empire is mine!&rdquo;
and Despot Ouglesha interposed angrily, &ldquo;You are both wrong, for
know that the Empire is <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youthful Tsarevitch remained silent, for he was not bold enough
to proffer a single word in the presence of his haughty elders.</p>
<p>King Voukashin prepared a message and sent it by a faithful servant
to the Archdeacon Nedelyko, at Prizrend, summoning him to come at once
to the field of Kossovo and state without delay to whom the Empire had
been left&mdash;for he must surely know, having received the last
confession of the illustrious Tsar Doushan the Mighty and been in
attendance upon him up to his death. Besides, it was known that the
Archdeacon had the archives under his care, and could at least produce
the Emperor&rsquo;s will. Despot Ouglesha also sent a missive to the
Archdeacon by his swiftest messenger; a third was written by
Vo&iuml;vode <span class="corr" id="xd19e2290" title=
"Source: Goyoko">Goyko</span>, who dispatched it by his special
courier, and a fourth was inscribed and sent off by Ourosh.</p>
<p>The messages were all dispatched secretly, but the couriers reached
Prizrend and met at the gates of Nedelyko&rsquo;s dwelling. But
Nedelyko had gone, as Court Chaplain, to officiate at the morning
service in the Cathedral. The men were enraged at the delay, and
without even alighting from their horses, they rushed infuriated, into
the sacred edifice, raised their whips and brutally struck the good
Archdeacon, commanding him: &ldquo;Behold, O Archdeacon Nedelyko!
Hasten now, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>this very hour, to the plain of Kossovo. Thou must
state to whom the Empire belongs, for thou hast received the confession
from the illustrious Tsar and administered the last sacrament to him,
and it is thou who hast the state records in thy care. Hasten, hasten,
lest we, in our fierce impatience, do sever thy head from thy
body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archdeacon Nedelyko wept with grief and mortification and thus
replied: &ldquo;Begone, ye servants of the most mighty princes! Begone
from the House of God! Suffer first that we end God&rsquo;s service,
then will I make known into whose hands the Empire is to
fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couriers then went out and awaited the coming of the Archdeacon.
Presently the Archdeacon came to them and spake in this wise: &ldquo;O
my children, messengers from the King himself, and from the Princes! I
received the last confession of our glorious Tsar, and gave him the
sacrament; but about the Empire and affairs of state he spoke never a
word, for we were concerned only with the sins that he had committed.
Ye must go to the city of Prilip, for there is the castle of the Royal
Prince Marko. Marko, as ye may remember, learned from me how to read
and write; later he was secretary to the Emperor and he was then
entrusted with the care of the records, and he will surely know to whom
the empire was entrusted. Call Marko to the field of Kossovo to say who
is now the Tsar. Marko will tell the truth, for he fears none but
God!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2302" class="main">Marko is Summoned</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The messenger set out at once, and, arriving at
Prilip, they smote on the portals of the castle. The knocking was heard
by Yevrossima, and she spoke thus to her son: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>&ldquo;O
Marko, my dearest son! who are they who knock at the gates below? They
may be messengers from thy father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko commanded that the gates should be opened, and when the
messengers entered they bowed with profoundest respect, and said:
&ldquo;May God always help thee, O noble Lord Marko!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince laid his hand upon their heads with kindness and said:
&ldquo;Be welcome, ye my dear children! Are the Serbian knights in good
health? And is all well with the glorious Tsar and King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couriers again made humble obeisance, saying: &ldquo;O noble
Lord, thou most Royal Prince Marko! All are well, though not, we fear,
upon friendly terms together! The King, thy father, and other princes
are seriously contending for the Empire upon Kossovo, that vast field
which is near the church Samodrezja; they are ready to stab each other
at any moment with their blades, for they know not to whom the Empire
rightly belongs. Thou art now called upon, O noble Prince, to proclaim
the heir to the Imperial crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bard goes on to narrate how Marko went to Yevrossima and asked
her advice, and although it was well known that Marko himself loved the
truth, his good mother implored him with the following words: &ldquo;O
Marko, thy mother&rsquo;s only son! May the food on which thou wert
nourished be not cursed! Speak not falsely either to please thy father,
or to satisfy the ambitions of thine uncles, but tell, I beg of thee,
the truth before God lest thou shouldest lose thy soul. It were better
that thou shouldst perish than sin against thy soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko took the ancient documents, mounted Sharatz and rode forthwith
to the plain of Kossovo. As he approached <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>his father&rsquo;s tent
King Voukashin saw him and exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, how fortunate am I!
Here is my son Marko; he will say that the Empire was left to me, for
of course he knows that it will pass from father to son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko heard this, but said not one single word, neither would he
turn his head towards the King&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>When Despot Ouglesha saw Marko, he spoke in this wise: &ldquo;Oh,
what a lucky thing for me! here is my nephew Marko; he is certain to
say the Empire is mine! Say, O Marko, the Empire is mine! We would
reign together, you and I, like brothers!&rdquo; Marko still kept
silent and did not even turn his head in the direction of his
uncle&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>As Vo&iuml;vode Goyko perceived his coming, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh,
here is a stroke of good fortune for me! here is my dear nephew Marko:
he is sure to say that the Empire was left to me. When Marko was a
little child I used to caress him fondly, for he was dear to me as a
golden apple, and always most precious. Whenever I rode out on
horseback I always used to take Marko with me. O Marko! dear Marko,
thou must say that the Empire is mine! It will be virtually thou who
shalt reign as Tsar, and I shall be at thy right hand, at all times
ready, as thy counsellor!&rdquo; Marko, still without a word, and
completely ignoring Vo&iuml;vode Goyko, went straight on to the tent
where Tsarevitch Ourosh was, and there he alighted from his
Sharatz.</p>
<p>When the young Ourosh saw him, he sprang from his silken couch, and
exclaimed: &ldquo;Hurrah! Behold my godfather Marko! Now he is going to
tell us who the true Tsar is!&rdquo; They embraced each other, inquired
after each other&rsquo;s health, and seated themselves upon the couch
from which Ourosh had just risen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"

<p class="first">Some time elapsed and the sun had set, the night
passed, morning dawned, and church bells called all to morning prayers,
and after the service the King, the Princes and great Lords went out
into the churchyard, where they took their places at tables, and ate
sweet-meats and drank brandy. Marko at last opened the ancient
documents, and said aloud: &ldquo;O my father, thou King Voukashin! Art
thou not content with thy Kingdom? May it be turned into a desert if
thou art not. Oh! that thou shouldst wish to seize another&rsquo;s
Empire! And thou, my uncle, Despot Ouglesha! Art thou not satisfied
within thine own territory? Is it indeed too small for thee that thou
must struggle for the Empire that belongs to another? May it also turn
into a desert! And thou, my uncle, thou Vo&iuml;vode Goyko! Is thy
Dukedom not vast enough for thee? May it likewise become a desert if it
is not! Oh that thou too shouldst strive for another&rsquo;s Tsardom?
Do ye not all see and understand? If ye fail to see may God not see ye!
It is clearly stated in the records that the Empire was left to Ourosh.
From father shall it pass to son. To this youth now belongs the
Imperial Crown of his ancestors. It was Ourosh whom our late Tsar, on
his dying day, named as his successor!&rdquo; When King Voukashin heard
this, he sprang to his feet, drew out his golden yatagan and would have
pierced his son with it. The Prince, pursued by his father, fled, for,
indeed, it would have been unseemly for Marko to fight with and perhaps
mortally strike his own father. Marko ran round the church <span class=
"corr" id="xd19e2335" title="Source: Samodreza">Samodrezja</span>, his
father closely following, till they had run round the building three
times, and then, when Voukashin was on the point of getting within
reach <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>of his son, all at once a mysterious voice from
within the church uttered these words: &ldquo;Run into the church, O,
thou Royal Prince Marko! Seest thou not that otherwise thou shalt
perish by thy father&rsquo;s hand, because thou hast spoken the truth
so dear to God?&rdquo; The doors suddenly opened of themselves and
Marko passed inside; then they closed and interposed themselves between
the two men. King Voukashin began to strike violently upon the doors
with his short hanging sword until he noticed that there were drops of
blood trickling down the beam, whereupon he was seized with remorse and
sighed in lowly penance, saying: &ldquo;Alas! Unfortunate man that I
am! O, thou infinite and divine God! Hear me! I have killed my son
Marko!&rdquo; But the mysterious voice from the church answered:
&ldquo;Behold! Voukashin thou most mighty King! Lo, thou hast not even
wounded thy son Marko, but thou hast injured the angel of the true
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words the King grew again enraged with Marko and cursed him
in these words: &ldquo;O Marko, my only son, may God kill thee! Mayest
thou never be entombed! Mayest thou have no son to come after thee! May
thy family end with thee! And, worse than all, may thy soul depart not
from thy body before thou hast served as vassal to the Turk!&rdquo; In
these bitter words the King cursed Marko, but the new Tsar, Ourosh,
blessed him, saying: &ldquo;O my beloved god-father, Marko! May God

<h3 id="xd19e2358" class="main">PRINCE MARKO AND A MOORISH
CHIEFTAIN</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A great and powerful Moorish chieftain had built for
himself a magnificent castle, rising to the height of twenty storeys.
The place he had chosen for the castle was by the sea, and when it was
quite completed he had panes of the most beautiful glass put in for
windows; he hung all the rooms and halls with the richest silks and
velvets and then soliloquized thus: &ldquo;O my <i>koula</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e2365src" href="#xd19e2365" name="xd19e2365src">7</a>
why have I erected thee? for there is no one but I who is there to
tread, with gentle footsteps, upon these fine rugs, and behold from
these windows the blue and shining sea. I have no mother, no sister,
and I have not yet found a wife. But I will assuredly go at once and
seek the Sultan&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. The Sultan must either
give me his daughter or meet me in single combat.&rdquo; As soon as the
Moor, gazing at his castle, had uttered these words, he wrote a most
emphatic letter to the Sultan at Istamboul,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e2370src" href="#xd19e2370" name="xd19e2370src">8</a> the contents
of which ran thus: &ldquo;O Sire, I have built a beautiful castle near
the shore of the azure sea, but as yet it has no mistress, for I have
no wife. I ask thee, therefore, to bestow upon me thy beloved daughter!
In truth, I demand this; for if thou dost not give thy daughter to me,
then prepare thyself at once to meet me face to face with thy sword. To
this fight I now challenge thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter reached the Sultan and he read it through. Immediately he
sought for one who would accept the challenge in his stead, promising
untold gold to the knight who would show himself willing to meet the
Moor. Many a bold man went forth to fight the Moor, but not one ever
returned to Istamboul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73"
name="pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>Alas! the Sultan soon found himself in a most embarrassing position
for all his best fighters had lost their lives at the hand of the
haughty Moor. But even this misfortune was not the worst. The Moor
prepared himself in all his splendour, not omitting his finest sabre;
then he proceeded to saddle his steed Bedevia, securely fastening the
seven belts and put on her a golden curb. On one side of the saddle he
fastened his tent, and this he balanced on the other side with his
heaviest club. He sprang like lightning on to his charger, and holding
before him, defiantly, his sharpest lance, he rode straight to
Istamboul.</p>
<p>The instant he reached the walls of the fort, he spread his tent,
struck his lance well into the earth, bound his Bedevia to the lance
and forthwith imposed on the inhabitants a daily tax, consisting of:
one sheep, one batch of white loaves, one keg of pure brandy, two
barrels of red wine, and a beautiful maiden. Each maiden, after being
his slave and attending on him for twenty-four hours, he would sell in
Talia for large sums of money. This imposition went on for three
months, for none could stop it. But even yet there was a greater evil
to be met.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2383" class="main">The Entrance of the Moor</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The inhabitants of Istamboul were terrorized one day
when the haughty Moor mounted upon his dashing steed entered the city.
He went to the Palace, and cried loudly: &ldquo;Lo! Sultan, wilt thou
now, once and for ever, give me thy daughter?&rdquo; As he received no
answer he struck the walls of the Palace with his club so violently
that the shattered glass poured down from the windows like rain. When
the Sultan saw that the Moor might easily destroy the Palace and even
the whole city in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span>this way, he was greatly alarmed, for he knew
that there was no alternative open to him in this horrible predicament
but to give up his only daughter. Although overwhelmed with shame,
therefore, he promised to do this. Pleased with his success, the Moor
asked for fifteen days&rsquo; delay before his marriage took place that
he might go back to his castle and make the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>When the Sultan&rsquo;s daughter heard of her father&rsquo;s
desperate resolution, she shrieked and exclaimed bitterly: &ldquo;Alas!
Behold my sorrow, O almighty <i>Allah</i>! For whom have I been taught
to prize my beauty? For a Moor? Can it be true that a Moor shall
imprint a kiss upon my visage?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2395" class="main">The Sultana&rsquo;s Dream</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That night the Sultana had a strange dream, in which
the figure of a man appeared before her, saying: &ldquo;There is within
the Empire of Serbia a vast plain Kossovo; in that plain there is a
city Prilip; and in that city dwells the Royal Prince Marko who is
known among all men as a truly great hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man went on to advise the Sultana to send, without delay, a
message to Prince Marko and beg him to become her son-in-God, and at
the same time to offer him immense fortune, for he was without doubt
the only one living likely to vanquish the terrible Moor and save her
daughter from a shameful fate. The next morning she sped to the
Sultan&rsquo;s apartments and told him of her dream. The Sultan
immediately wrote a <i>firman</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e2403src"
href="#xd19e2403" name="xd19e2403src">9</a> and sent it to Prince Marko
at Prilip, beseeching him to journey with all speed to Istamboul and
accept the challenge of the Moor, and if he should succeed in saving
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>the Princess the Sultan would give him three
<i>tovars</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e2412src" href="#xd19e2412"
name="xd19e2412src">10</a> of pure golden ducats.</p>
<p>When Marko read the firman, he said to the Sultan&rsquo;s young
courier, a native of Tartary: &ldquo;In the name of God go back, thou
Sultan&rsquo;s messenger, and greet thy master&mdash;my
father-in-God&mdash;tell him that I dare not face the Moor. Do we not,
all of us, know that he is invincible? If he should cleave my head
asunder, of what avail would three tovars, or three thousand tovars, of
gold be to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Tartar brought back Marko&rsquo;s answer which caused the
Sultana so much grief, that she determined to send a letter to him
herself, once more beseeching him to accept the challenge and this time
increasing the reward to five tovars of pure gold. But Marko, though
generally so chivalrous and courteous to all women, remained
inexorable, replying that he would not meet the Moor in combat even if
he were to be presented with all the treasure the Sultan possessed; for
he did not dare.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2422" class="main">The Princess appeals to Marko</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the broken-hearted bride heard that this answer
had come from Marko she sprang to her feet, took a pen and some paper,
struck her rosy cheek with the pen and with her own blood traced the
following: &ldquo;Hail, my dear brother-in-God, O, thou Royal Prince
Marko! Be a true brother to me! May God and Saint John be our
witnesses! I implore thee, do not suffer me to become the wife of the
Moor! I promise thee seven tovars of pure gold, seven
<i>boshtchaluks</i>, which have been neither woven nor spun, but are
embroidered with pure gold. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>Moreover, I shall give thee a golden
plate decorated with a golden snake, whose raised head is holding in
its mouth a priceless gem, from which is shed a light of such
brilliance, that by it alone you can see at the darkest hour of
midnight as well as you can at noon. In addition to these I shall
present thee with a finely tempered sabre; this sabre has three hilts,
all of pure gold, and in each of them is set a precious stone. The
sabre alone is worth three cities. I shall affix to this weapon the
Sultan&rsquo;s seal so that the Grand Vizir may never put thee to death
without first receiving his Majesty&rsquo;s special command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had read this missive, Marko reflected thus: &ldquo;Alas! O
my dear sister-in-God! It would be but to my great misfortune if I came
to serve thee, and to my still greater misfortune if I stayed away.
For, although I fear neither the Sultan nor the Sultana, I do in all
truth fear God and Saint John, by whom thou hast adjured me! Therefore
I now resolve to come and, if necessary, to face certain
death!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2435" class="main">Marko prepares to succour the
Princess</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having sent away the Princess&rsquo; messenger without
telling him what he had resolved to do, Marko entered his castle and
put on his cloak and a cap, made of wolves&rsquo; skins; next he girded
on his sabre, selected his most piercing lance, and went to the
stables. For greater safety he fastened the seven belts under the
saddle of his Sharatz with his own hands; he then attached a leathern
bottle filled with red wine on one side of his saddle and his
weightiest war-club on the other. Now he was ready and threw himself
upon Sharatz and rode off to Istamboul.</p>
<p>Upon reaching his destination he did not go to pay his respects
either to the Sultan or to the Grand Vizir, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>quietly
took up his abode in a new inn. That same evening, soon after sun-set,
he led his horse to a lake near by to be refreshed: but to his
master&rsquo;s surprise Sharatz would not even taste the water, but
kept turning his head first to the right, then to the left, till Marko
noticed the approach of a Turkish maiden covered with a long
gold-embroidered veil. When she reached the edge of the water she bowed
profoundly toward the lake and said aloud: &ldquo;God bless thee, O
beauteous green lake! God bless thee, for thou art to be my home for
ever more! Within thy bosom am I henceforth to dwell; I am now to die,
O beauteous lake; rather would I choose such a fate than become the
bride of the cruel Moor!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2444" class="main">Marko greets the Princess</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marko went nearer to the maiden and spoke thus:
&ldquo;O, thou unhappy Turkish maiden! What is thy trouble? What is it
that has made thee wish to drown thyself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered: &ldquo;Leave me in peace, thou ugly
<i>dervish</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2453src" href="#xd19e2453"
name="xd19e2453src">11</a> why dost thou ask me, when there is nought
that thou canst do to help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the maiden related the story of her coming marriage with the
Moorish chieftain, of the messages sent to Marko, and finally she
bitterly cursed that Prince for the hardness of his heart.</p>
<p>Thereupon Marko said: &ldquo;O, curse me not, dear sister-in-God!
Marko is here and is now speaking to thee himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing these words the maiden turned toward the famous knight,
embraced him and earnestly pleaded: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, O
my brother Marko! Suffer not the Moor to wed me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko was greatly affected, and declared: &ldquo;O dear
sister-in-God! I swear that so long as my head remains upon my
shoulders, I shall never let the Moor have thee! Do not tell others
that thou hast seen me here, but request the Sultan and thy mother to
have supper prepared and sent to the inn for me, and, above all things,
beg them to send me plenty of wine. Meanwhile I shall await the
Moor&rsquo;s coming at the inn. When the Moor arrives at the Palace,
thy parents should welcome him graciously, and they should go so far as
to yield thee to him in order to avoid a quarrel. And I know exactly
the spot where I shall be able to rescue thee, if it may so please the
true God, and if my customary good luck, and my strength, do not desert
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince returned to the inn, and the maiden hastened back to the
Palace.</p>
<p>When the Sultan and the Sultana knew that Marko had come to their
aid, they were much comforted, and immediately ordered a sumptuous
repast to be sent to him, especially good red wine in abundance.</p>
<p>Now all the shops in Istamboul were closed, and there was silence
everywhere as Marko sat drinking the delicious wine in peace. The
landlord of the inn came presently to close his doors and windows, and,
questioned by Marko as to why the citizens were all shutting up their
dwellings so early that day, he answered: &ldquo;By my faith, you are
indeed a stranger here! The Moorish chieftain has asked for our
Sultan&rsquo;s daughter in marriage, and as, to our shame, she is to be
yielded to him, he is coming to the Palace to fetch her this day.
Therefore, owing to our terror of the Moor, we are forced to close our
shops.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>But Marko did not allow the man to close the door
of the inn, for he wished to see the Moor and his gorgeous train pass
by.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2477" class="main">The Moor in Istamboul</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At that very moment, as they were speaking, Marko
could hear from the city the clangour caused by the Moorish chieftain
and his black followers, numbering at least five hundred, and all in
glittering armour. The Moor had roused his Bedevia, and she trotted in
such a lively manner that the stones, which she threw up with her
hoofs, whizzed through the air in all directions, and broke windows and
doors in all the shops she passed! When the cavalcade came up to the
inn, the Moor thought: &ldquo;Allah! I am struck with wonder and
astonishment! The windows and doors of all the shops and houses
throughout the entire city of Istamboul are closed from the great fear
the people have of me, except, I see, the doors of this inn. There must
either be nobody within, or if there is anybody inside, he is assuredly
a great fool; or perhaps he is a stranger, and has not yet been told
how terrible I am.&rdquo; The Moor and his retinue passed that night in
tents before the Palace.</p>
<p>Next morning the Sultan himself presented his daughter to the
Moorish chieftain, together with all the wedding gifts, which were
known to weigh twelve tovars. As the wedding procession passed the inn
where Marko waited, the Moor again noticed the open door, but this time
he urged Bedevia right up to it to see who might be there.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2484" class="main">Sharatz and Bedevia</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marko was seated at his ease in the most comfortable
room the inn could boast, leisurely drinking his favourite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>red
wine; he was not drinking from an ordinary goblet, but from a bowl
which held twelve litres; and each time he filled the bowl he would
drink only one half of its contents, giving, according to his habit,
the other half to his Sharatz. The Moor was on the point of attacking
Marko, when Sharatz barred his way and kicked viciously at Bedevia. The
Moor, meeting such unexpected resistance, promptly turned to rejoin the
procession. Then Marko rose to his feet, and, turning his cloak and cap
inside out, so that to the first glance of those who saw him he
presented the terrifying appearance of a wolf, inspected his weapons
and Sharatz&rsquo;s belts carefully, and dashed on his charger after
the procession. He felled horsemen right and left, till he reached the
dever and the second witness, and killed them both. The Moorish
chieftain was immediately told of the stranger who had forced his way
into the midst of the procession, and of those whom he had killed, also
that he did not look like other knights, being clad in wolves&rsquo;
skins.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2491" class="main">Marko and the Moor</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Moor astride his Bedevia, wheeled round and
addressed Marko thus: &ldquo;Ill fortune is indeed overtaking thee
to-day, O stranger! Thou must have been driven here by Satan to disturb
my guests and even kill my dever and second witness; thou must be
either a fool, knowing nothing of to-day&rsquo;s events, or thou must
be extremely fierce and hast gone mad; but maybe thou art merely tired
of life? By my faith, I shall draw in the reins of my Bedevia, and
shall spring over thy body seven times; then shall I strike off thy
head!&rdquo; Thereupon Marko answered: &ldquo;Cease these lies, O Moor!
If God, and my usual luck, do but attend me now, thou shalt not even
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>spring near to me; still less can I imagine thee
carrying out thy intention of springing over my body!&rdquo; But,
behold! The Moor drew in his Bedevia, spurred her violently forward and
indeed he would have sprung over Marko, had not Sharatz been the
well-trained fighter that he was, and in a trice he reared so as to
receive the adversary against his forefeet and swiftly bit off
Bedevia&rsquo;s right ear, from which blood gushed forth profusely and
streamed down over her neck and chest. In this way Marko and the Moor
struggled for four hours. Neither would give way, and when finally the
Moor saw that Marko was overpowering him, he wheeled his steed Bedevia
round and fled along the main street of Istamboul, Marko after him. But
the Moor&rsquo;s Bedevia was swift as a veela of the forest, and would
certainly have escaped from Sharatz if Marko had not suddenly
recollected his club, and flung it after his adversary, striking him
between his shoulders. The Moor fell from his horse and the Prince
severed his head from his body. Next he captured Bedevia, returned to
the street where he had left the bride, and found, to his astonishment,
that she with her twelve tovars of presents, was alone, awaiting him,
for all the wedding-guests and the retinue of the Moorish chieftain had
fled at full gallop. Marko escorted the Princess back to the Sultan,
and cast the head of the Moorish chieftain at his feet.</p>
<p>The hero now took his leave and started at once on his journey back
to Prilip, and the following morning he received the seven tovars of
gold which had been promised to him, the many precious gifts which the
Princess had described, and last of all a message thanking him for the
marvellous deeds he had done, and telling him that the vast stores of
gold belonging to his father-in-God, the Sultan, would for ever be at
his disposal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

<h3 id="xd19e2502" class="main">PRINCE MARKO ABOLISHES THE WEDDING
TAX</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early one morning the Royal Prince Marko rode across
the plain of Kossovo. When he reached the river a maiden from Kossovo
met him, and Marko greeted her in the usual Serbian custom: &ldquo;May
God aid thee, O maiden of Kossovo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden bowed very profoundly, and answered: &ldquo;Hail! thou
unknown hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko, after having looked for a while at her, said: &ldquo;Dear
sister, thou maiden of Kossovo, thou art beauteous, though thou
mightest well be a little younger! Thou art tall, strong and graceful;
thy cheeks look healthful and thou hast a pleasing and dignified
appearance. But, alas! dear sister, thy hair is grey and becomes thee
not. Who caused thy sorrow? Tell me, is it thyself, thy mother or thy
aged father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden shed many bitter tears, and amidst her sobs answered
Marko thus: &ldquo;O dear brother, thou unknown knight! I am not the
cause of mine own misfortune, and it is neither my mother nor yet my
father who has brought great trouble upon me; but I have lost all
happiness through the evil-doing of a Moor who dwells beyond the sea.
He has taken possession of the whole field of Kossovo and has imposed,
among other extortions, a terrible tax of thirty ducats to be paid by
all brides, and thirty-four ducats by all bridegrooms. My brothers are
poor and have not the money necessary to pay my tax, therefore I am
unable to wed my sweetheart and have thus lost all happiness. Merciful
God, should I not go and take my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Prince Marko said: &ldquo;Dear sister, thou maiden
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>of Kossovo! Do not trifle with thy life; abandon
every such idea, else thou shalt bring sin upon thy soul! Tell me,
where is the castle where the Moorish Lord may be found? I think I have
something to say to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the maiden answered: &ldquo;O my brother, thou unknown
knight! Why dost thou inquire about his castle? How I wish it could be
razed to the ground! Thou hast, perhaps, found a maiden according to
thy heart and thou goest now to pay the wedding tax, or art thou the
only son of thy dear mother? I fear for thee, O brother, for thou
mayest perish there, and what then would thy sorrowful and lonely
mother do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko plunged his hand into his pocket, took out a purse and handed
it to the maiden saying: &ldquo;O sister! take these thirty ducats, go
home and await in peace for what may befall thee;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e2520src" href="#xd19e2520" name="xd19e2520src">12</a> only kindly
point out to me the castle of the Moor, for I am going to pay him thy
wedding tax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the maiden, glowing with unexpected happiness spoke thus:
&ldquo;It is not a castle, but tents (and may they be cursed!). Seest
thou not upon the plain where flutters that silken flag? There is the
Moor&rsquo;s own pavilion; around it grows a pleasant garden which he
has dared to decorate with the heads of seventy-seven Christian heroes,
and he has forty servants, who are, day and night, on guard near
by.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2529" class="main">Marko visits the Moor</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Upon hearing these words Marko took leave of the
maiden and rode toward the tents. He urged his steed so violently that
under his hoofs living fire shone, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>from his nostrils
appeared a bright blue flame. Mad with anger Marko rode fiercely across
the camp and, with tears streaming from his eyes which were fixed upon
the plain of Kossovo he exclaimed: &ldquo;Alas, O plain of Kossovo! Oh!
to think that thou shouldst have remained to see this day! And, after
the reign of our great Emperor,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2535src"
href="#xd19e2535" name="xd19e2535src">13</a> that thou shouldst be here
to witness the tyranny of a Moor! Can I endure such shame and sorrow:
Oh! that the Moors should be allowed to ravage thee! Now shall I either
avenge thee, or perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentinels observed Marko&rsquo;s arrival and went to inform
their Lord: &ldquo;O Master, thou Moor! A strange and fierce hero,
riding a piebald steed, is approaching; and it is plain that he intends
to attack us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Moor answered indifferently: &ldquo;O my children, ye forty
true servants of mine! That hero will not attack us. He is undoubtedly
bringing his wedding tax and, because he regrets the amount of money he
has to give up, he is impatiently urging on his charger. You had better
go forth and welcome him; take his steed and his weapons from him and
show him to my tent. I do not care for his treasure, but I am quite
willing to cleave his head and seize his courser, which would suit me
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants went forth to obey, but when they saw Marko near, they
were so terrified that they did not dare face him, but fled to hide
themselves behind their chieftain, concealing their yataghans under
their cloaks at the sight of Marko.</p>
<p>As the fierce Prince came up, he alighted in front of the opening of
the tent and spoke aside to his trusty courser: &ldquo;Walk about
alone, my Sharo,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I am going into this tent
to see the Moor; go not too far from this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>spot, as should evil
happen I may have need of thee!&rdquo; Then Marko entered the
pavilion.</p>
<p>The Moorish chieftain sat enjoying cool wine which was poured out
for him by a Christian woman and a maiden. The princely Marko saluted
the Moor: &ldquo;May God help thee, my Lord!&rdquo; The Moorish
chieftain answered: &ldquo;Hail, thou unknown knight! Be seated, that
we may drink wine together ere thou dost tell me why thou hast come
hither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Marko answered: &ldquo;I have no time to drink with thee; but
I have come with the intention of seeing thee. I have found a maiden
after my own heart, my guests and their horses await me a little way
down the road, while I came to pay thee my wedding tax. I shall at once
give thee the gold so that nothing may hinder my happiness. Tell me
now, what must I pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moor answered in a very friendly manner: &ldquo;Well, thou
oughtest to have known that long ago: it was thirty ducats for brides
and thirty-four for bridegrooms; but as thou appearest to be a
distinguished knight, it would not hurt either of us if thou gavest me
a round hundred ducats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Marko took out of his pocket three ducats and laid them
before the haughty Moor, saying: &ldquo;Believe me I have no more
money; I should be grateful if thou wouldest wait till I reach my
bride&rsquo;s house, for there we shall certainly receive many rich
presents. I shall give thee all the presents and will retain the bride
only for myself!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thereupon the mighty Moor shouted out, bitterly
enraged: &ldquo;I allow no credit, thou wretch! Thou art bold enough
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>to laugh at me!&rdquo; Then he sprang to his feet,
raised his club and struck Marko&rsquo;s shoulders three or four
times.</p>
<p>Marko smiling, said: &ldquo;Heroic Moor, dost thou strike in earnest
or dost thou merely strike in jest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moor, continuing the assault, hissed: &ldquo;I beat thee in
earnest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko smiled again, and remarked: &ldquo;Oh, then, I pity thee!
Since thou art striking with serious intent, know then that I too have
a club. Now I shall smite thee as many times as thou hast struck me, no
more than that! Let us make it a fair fight!&rdquo; With this, Marko
raised his mace and smote the Moor with such force that his head fell
from his shoulders!</p>
<p>At this Marko burst into laughter: &ldquo;Merciful God, mayest thou
be thanked! How quickly the Moorish hero&rsquo;s head was cleft
asunder! It now lies just as if it had never been upon his
shoulders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now unsheathed his sword, and caught the Moor&rsquo;s bodyguard,
cleaving also their heads one after the other, except four of their
number, whom he left to tell the tale to all who wished to hear the
truth. Then he took down the heads of the Christian heroes and
carefully buried them, that wolves and vultures might not devour them.
He next instructed the four remaining servants to run across the field
of Kossovo, north, east, south, and west, and to proclaim to all that
maids and youths were henceforth free to marry without paying the hated
tax, for had not the Royal Prince Marko come and paid once for all?</p>
<p>When the oppressed Christians learned the news, they all, young and
old, joined in the joyful cry: &ldquo;May God grant Royal Prince Marko
long life! For Marko has freed our land of a monster! We pray to God
that his soul may be purified of all sin.&rdquo; <span class=

<h3 id="xd19e2578" class="main">PRINCE MARKO AND BOGDAN THE BULLY</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early one morning three Serbian knights rode out from
Kossovo; one was Prince Marko of Prilip; the second was Relya of Bazar,
and the third was Milosh of Potzerye. They were bound for the seashore,
and their way lay through the vineyards of Bogdan the Bully. Relya of
Bazar was a joyous young knight, and he encouraged his steed to prance
gaily through the vineyard, whereby he broke some of the tall vines
loaded with sweet grapes.</p>
<p>Marko admonished his friend thus: &ldquo;Thou hadst better leave
these vineyards alone, O my Relya! If thou only knewest whose they are
thou wouldst keep thy courser under careful control: for they belong to
Bogdan the Bully. Once I, myself, was riding through these very
vineyards, and as I was young then, I also made my Sharatz prance
along, as thou art doing. But, alas! I was seen by Bogdan riding on his
slender mare Bedevia. I knew that I was at fault and, as the true God
does not support guilty men, I dared not face him, but fled up the
rocky coast. He pursued me, and if I had not had my trusty Sharatz he
would indeed have caught me. But thanks to Sharatz I at last got
farther and farther from him. When Bogdan saw that at the rate I was
fleeting he could never reach me, he swiftly threw his club after me
and just touched my back with its handle, so that I fell forward over
on the ears of my Sharatz and regained my seat only by a great effort.
However, I did escape him. This happened some seven years ago, since
when I have not come this way until to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;But thanks to Sharatz I got farther and

</div>
<p>As Marko said this, the three knights noticed in the distance a
cloud of dust, in the midst of which they recognized <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>Bogdan
with twelve attendants on horseback. Marko exclaimed: &ldquo;Hark ye,
my two brothers-in-God! Here he is! and he will surely kill all three
of us if we do not make our escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Milosh of Potzerye answered: &ldquo;O my brother-in-God,
thou Royal Prince Marko! The whole people believe that there are no
greater heroes living than we three Serbian knights; it would be far
better for us all to perish than shamefully to flee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marko heard this, he said: &ldquo;Listen to me, my
brothers-in-God! Since that is so, let us divide the enemy. Will ye
face Bogdan alone or his twelve knights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh and Relya chose to fight Bogdan alone, leaving Marko to meet
the twelve followers. This division was quite agreeable to Marko, and
it was hardly arranged than Bogdan came up at the head of his troop. He
was immediately engaged by Milosh and Relya, while Marko turned his
attention to the twelve attendants. Swinging his heavy mace he urged
Sharatz against his foes, and in a very short time all were hurled to
the ground. Marko then alighted from his horse, bound their hands
behind them, and drove them through the vineyards.</p>
<p>He had gone but a little distance when he saw Bogdan driving toward
him his two friends, their arms bound in the same manner as those of
Bogdan&rsquo;s followers. At this Marko was seized with fear and looked
around for a means of escape. The next moment he remembered that the
three brothers-in-God had sworn faithfulness one to another, and that
they were pledged at all times to help one another. So tightening
Sharatz&rsquo;s reins he drew his helmet over his forehead, furiously
unsheathed his trusty sabre, and cast one fierce, dark glance at
Bogdan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the Bully saw the terrific fury and determination
in Marko&rsquo;s eyes his legs shook beneath him, and he turned his
mare away, not daring to meet Marko face to face. He could not,
however, hope to escape the vengeance of the Prince, and so after a
short silence he called out: &ldquo;Come, O Marko, let us be
reconciled. Wilt thou release my twelve attendants? If thou art willing
to do that I shall in turn set free thy brothers-in-God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko agreed to this, and alighting from Sharatz, he unhooked from
his saddle a skin of wine, and they all sat down to refresh themselves
with the cool wine and to partake of freshly gathered grapes. When they
had rested, the three friends mounted their horses and prepared to
depart. As they were about to ride off Marko thus addressed Bogdan:
&ldquo;Mayest thou prosper with God&rsquo;s help, O Bogdan! And may we
meet again some day in good health and once more drink
together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Bogdan replied: &ldquo;Farewell! and may God ever help thee,
O thou Royal Prince Marko! But may my eyes never again behold thee!
Seeing how thou hast terrified me this day, I do not think that I shall
wish ever to meet thee again!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hark! Is it thunder or is it an earthquake? Neither,
but guns are roaring from fort Varadin: General Voutcha is feasting in
triumph, for he has captured three Serbian heroes; the first is Milosh
of Potzerye, the second is Milan of Toplitza, and the third is Ivan
Kosantchitch. The General has thrown them into the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>deepest
dungeons of his castle, noisome holes where stagnant water lies
knee-deep and the bones of warriors lie piled as high as the shoulders
of a hero.</p>
<p>Milosh of Potzerye is of noble lineage, unaccustomed to privation
and suffering, and he bitterly laments and deplores his fate, as he
peers anxiously through the grating of the massive door into the dark
passage by which alone succour might come. And, indeed, after three
days he saw a messenger, to whom he called: &ldquo;O, my
brother-in-God! Bring me that whereon I may inscribe a
missive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was pleased to be called a brother-in-God of such a famous
hero and swiftly brought a roll to Milosh, who inscribed on it the
following words: &ldquo;To the Royal Prince Marko of Prilip: O
brother-in-God, thou princely Marko! Either thou dost not want to hear
more of me or thou hast ceased to care for me! Fate has been hard, and
I have fallen, O brother, into the hands of a foe. The Magyar Voutcha
has captured me and my two brothers-in-arms. We have been immured in
this vile dungeon for three whole days, and it is impossible that we
should remain for another three days and live. Therefore, if thou
wouldst see us again, rescue us, O brother, either by heroic deeds or
by ransom!&rdquo; Milosh scratched his cheek and sealed the missive
with his blood; he then handed it to the man, together with twelve
ducats, and implored him to hasten with it to Prilip. The messenger
rode with all speed, arriving at the city of Prilip on a Sunday
morning. Prince Marko was coming out of church when the courier dashed
up to him with the missive. As the Prince read of the terrible straits
in which his friends found themselves tears ran down his cheeks, and he
swore that he would save his noble brothers-in-God. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bard here describes Marko&rsquo;s preparations in much the same
manner as in the ballad, &ldquo;Prince Marko and the Moorish
Chieftain.&rdquo; Next he tells of the journey from Prilip to Varadin,
but not without exaggerating as a matter of course, the wonderful
alertness of Sharatz, who, on this occasion, swam across the
Danube.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2628" class="main">The Arrival of Marko</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Arrived on the plain before the castle of Varadin,
Marko spread his tent, unhooked his skin of wine, the contents of which
he drank from a bowl &lsquo;containing twelve <i>okas</i>&rsquo; (about
forty-eight pints), never forgetting to have half the quantity of wine
each time he filled the bowl, for his beloved Sharatz. This action was
observed by a fair Magyar lady, the wife of General Voutcha&rsquo;s son
Velimir, and being alarmed at seeing such a strange hero, she was
suddenly seized with a fever (&lsquo;which will torture her for three
years&rsquo;) and hastened to tell the General what she had seen, and
described to him every detail of Marko&rsquo;s attire.</p>
<p>But General Voutcha, feigning indifference, comforted his beloved
daughter-in-law, promising that he would capture him as easily as he
had captured the three knights already lying in his dungeons. Voutcha
called his son, whom he ordered to take three hundred horsemen, and
seize the haughty stranger immediately.</p>
<p>Marko sitting and enjoying his wine, did not see the approach of
Velimir, but the faithful Sharatz began striking the earth with his
right forefoot, thus warning his unobservant master. Marko understood,
turned his head, and saw that a whole squadron was surrounding him; so
he drank one more bowl of wine, threw the vessel on the grass, sprang
on to his horse and fiercely attacked the army, &lsquo;as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>a falcon
attacks the timid pigeons.&rsquo; One portion he cut to pieces, the
second he ran down with his Sharatz, and the third he drowned in the
Danube.</p>
<p>But Velimir nearly escaped him, thanks to his own speedy charger.
When Marko saw that Sharatz, tired out, could not possibly come up with
Velimir&rsquo;s horse, he remembered his mace, which he now hurled so
skilfully that the heavy handle only touched the youth with sufficient
force to fling him to the earth. Marko was by his side immediately and
he had Velimir securely bound, whereupon he threw him down on to the
soft, green grass, and went on drinking more of his wine.</p>
<p>Velimir&rsquo;s wife had witnessed the whole of the proceedings, and
she now ran swiftly to the General, who was furious at the intelligence
and ordered all the siege-guns to be fired. Then he collected three
thousand warriors and mounting his mare he led this host against
Marko.</p>
<p>The Magyars completely surrounded the hero, but Marko saw nothing of
it as he went on sipping his wine. Sharatz, however, was watchful and
came to the side of his master, who, realizing his critical position,
sprang to the saddle and, more furious than before, rushed fiercely at
the Magyars, with his sabre in his right hand, his lance in his left,
and Sharatz&rsquo;s reins held firmly in his teeth. Those whom he
struck with his sabre, he cut in two; those he touched with his lance,
were thrown over his head.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2648" class="main">Marko captures General Voutcha</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After three or four encounters Marko had killed so
many Magyars that those who were left, filled with horror, fled in
disorder. Marko next captured General Voutcha in the same manner as he
had his son, and after tying his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>hands, bound him to his
Sharatz&rsquo;s saddle and carried him off to where Velimir lay
groaning. Making the two of them fast to the General&rsquo;s mare, he
proceeded to Prilip and cast them prisoners into a dungeon.</p>
<p>A few days later he received a letter from Voutcha&rsquo;s wife,
beseeching him not to destroy Velimir and his father, and offering him
vast sums of gold as ransom. And Marko sent the following answer:
&ldquo;Behold! thou faithful consort of General Voutcha! If thou
desireth that I should release my prisoners, thou hast but to release
my old friends Milan of Toplitza and Ivan Kosantchitch and give to each
three tovars of gold to compensate for the time he has wasted in
prison; and thou must also give me a like sum, for I have had to
overwork my good Sharatz. And there is still my friend Milosh of
Potzerye within your castle, but I authorize him to settle his own
affairs with you in person, for I agree to whatsoever he may
arrange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife of the General lost no time in sending the required
quantity of gold. Then she took the keys of the dungeons, and released
the heroes; sent for a number of barbers to shave their beards, and to
attend to their hair and nails. She next ordered a large quantity of
the finest wines and most costly dishes to be served to the noble
Serbians, and after the feast, she narrated to them Marko&rsquo;s
wonderful deeds, beseeching Milosh of Potzerye to use all his influence
and persuade the princely Marko to have mercy on her husband and her
son. Thereupon Milosh promised that her wish should be gratified, and
that she had no need to fear. Only he requested her to give him: first,
the best horse from General Voutcha&rsquo;s stables, the one that
Voutcha rode once a year to go in state to the church at Tekiye;
secondly, the gilded coach, harnessed with twelve Arabian coursers used
by General Voutcha <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"
name="pb94">94</a>]</span>when travelling to Vienna on his visits to
the Emperor, for in that carriage Milosh wished to drive home the aged
hero, Milan of Toplitza. And finally he asked that his friend Toplitza
might be allowed to wear the fine attire which the General wore on
Easter day. To all this Voutcha&rsquo;s wife agreed and, moreover, she
gave each of the friends one thousand ducats in order that they might
not be short of wine on their journey to Prilip.</p>
<p>Marko greeted the knights in a warm brotherly manner, and then
released General Voutcha and his son Velimir, ordering a powerful
convoy to escort them to Varadin. When the noble Serbian vo&iuml;vodes
had enjoyed Marko&rsquo;s hospitality for several days (consuming
during that time a formidable quantity of his red wine) they embraced
and kissed each other on the cheek; the friends, in addition, kissing
Marko&rsquo;s uncovered hand. Then each proceeded in peace to his own
domains.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2663" class="main">PRINCE MARKO&rsquo;S WEDDING
PROCESSION</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One evening as Prince Marko sat at meat with his aged
mother, she requested him to seek a maiden of his heart, that she might
enjoy the companionship and support of a daughter-in-law. Thereupon
Marko answered: &ldquo;May God be my witness, O mother dear! I have
journeyed through nine kingdoms and through the whole Turkish empire,
and whenever I found the maiden I wished to make my bride, I never
found that thou wert of the same mind with me. Sometimes it was that
thou didst not feel friendly toward her family; and when I chanced to
find a family to thy liking there was never the maiden thou didst
desire for me! Howbeit, when I was wandering through Bulgaria I once
reined my Sharatz near a well, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>and lo! there I saw a maiden so
fair and gentle, that all at once it seemed to me as if the grass near
where we stood were turning round us again and again. Later I learned
that this maiden was the daughter of King Shishman of Bulgaria:
assuredly this would be the very maiden for me and a family which would
please thee! If thou approvest, therefore, I will at once go and ask
her in marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko&rsquo;s mother, delighted with this choice of her son,
hastened to prepare the usual presents that very night, for she feared
her son might change his mind before the morrow. Next morning, however,
Marko ordered Sharatz to be saddled, and slinging the necessary skin of
wine on one side of the saddle and his war-club on the other, he took
leave of his mother and rode straight to the castle of King
Shishman.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian sovereign saw Marko while he was still a long way off,
and walked forth to greet him. When he was quite close, Marko alighted
from Sharatz, stretched out his arms and the two embraced, each
inquiring after the state of the other&rsquo;s health. The King then
led Marko into the castle while Sharatz was taken by the grooms to the
royal stables.</p>
<p>A little later, in the course of the gorgeous banquet which had been
immediately arranged in honour of the princely guest, Marko sprang to
his feet, bowed deeply before the King and asked his daughter&rsquo;s
hand in marriage. The King was so pleased to have such a noble and
valiant son-in-law that he consented without hesitation. Marko expended
three tovars of gold on the ring to be worn by his future bride, for
her wedding-robe and other presents. Next he asked if he might return
to Prilip to gather his wedding guests and friends, and as he was on
the point of leaving the Palace, the Queen specially advised the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>Prince not to select as the bride&rsquo;s leader
one whom he could not trust implicitly, but rather to choose his own
brother or at least a cousin, for, said she, a stranger might possibly
prove a rival, so charming and beauteous was her daughter.</p>
<p>When Marko came near to Prilip, his mother walked forth to greet
him, and, after embracing him warmly on both cheeks and giving him her
fair hands to kiss, she inquired if he had had a prosperous journey and
had become betrothed to the Princess. Marko narrated all that had
happened, and did not forget to repeat the Queen&rsquo;s words at
parting, complaining of his great misfortune in that his brothers were
dead, neither had he a cousin. His mother, filled with joy, advised
Marko not to lament because of that, but to send at once a message to
the Doge of Venice, inviting him to come with a company of five hundred
and to act as koom; also to send to Styepan Zemlyitch, asking him to
join the wedding party with five hundred followers and to be the
bride&rsquo;s leader.</p>
<p>Marko thought the counsel good and dispatched couriers forthwith, as
his mother advised. The Doge soon appeared with his five hundred
horsemen and Styepan Zemlyitch likewise. Marko welcomed them cordially
and hospitably, and there was no lack of good red wine.</p>
<p>The company now proceeded to the court of the Bulgarian King, who
received them most heartily and feasted them for three days. On the
fourth day the wedding party prepared to return for it was evident that
if the guests were to remain for another three days the King would have
no wine left. Shishman presented all with royal gifts: to some he gave
silks, to others costly shirts, to others again golden dishes and
plates; to the bride&rsquo;s leader was presented a special shirt
embroidered in gold. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>When the bride was mounted, her royal father
presented her to the bride&rsquo;s leader with these words: &ldquo;Here
are now, in thy keeping, the bride and her horse till thou arrivest at
Marko&rsquo;s castle; once there thou shalt give Marko the bride, but
her courser thou mayst retain for thyself!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2686" class="main">The Wedding Procession</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The procession rode on through the Bulgarian woodland
and meadows, and as there is no happiness without some misfortune, a
gust of wind blew aside for a moment the bride&rsquo;s veil. The Doge
of Venice, riding close by her side, beheld the maiden&rsquo;s fair
face and was so fascinated by her wondrous beauty that he fell
violently in love with her. When the whole party of wedding guests
halted for the night, he went unperceived to the tent of Styepan
Zemlyitch, addressing him thus: &ldquo;O thou bride&rsquo;s leader!
Wilt thou yield to me thy charge that we may flee together: I will give
thee a bootful of golden ducats!&rdquo; Styepan Zemlyitch answered
indignantly: &ldquo;Keep silent, thou Doge of Venice! Mayest thou be
turned to stone! Hast thou made up thy mind to perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the halting-place on the second day, the Doge
again went secretly to the tent of Styepan Zemlyitch and once more
asked for the bride, but this time he offered two bootfuls of ducats.
Again the bride&rsquo;s leader refused, saying: &ldquo;Begone, O Doge!
Lest thou shouldst have thy head cleft asunder! Has anybody ever heard
of a koom taking his kooma from her bridegroom?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2693" class="main">The Unfaithful Koom</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the third night came, the Doge offered to the
bride&rsquo;s leader three bootfuls of pure golden ducats. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>enormous sum of money was too great a temptation
for the bride&rsquo;s leader, and he gave up the bride to the Doge, who
conducted her to his own tent. Then he declared his love to the maiden,
and in impassioned tones implored her to fly with him to Venice, where
he could offer her all that heart could desire. But the Bulgarian
maiden turned from him with loathing. &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, O
thou Doge of Venice!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the earth under us would
surely crack to swallow us and the skies above us would burst asunder
if a kooma should thus be false to her bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Doge persisted: &ldquo;Oh do not be so foolish, my sweet
kooma! I have kissed and caressed many koomas, but never once did the
earth open under us, or the heavens burst asunder. Come, let us
embrace!&rdquo; The maiden thought it well to dissemble, and she
replied: &ldquo;O my koom, thou Doge of Venice! My aged mother told me
that I should have her curse if I ever kissed a bearded hero; and I
swore to her that I should love only a shaven knight such as is the
Royal Prince Marko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the Doge called two barbers: one to shave his beard and
the other to wash his face clean. As they were thus engaged the maiden
stooped and gathered up, unnoticed, the Doge&rsquo;s beard and wrapped
it in the folds of her silken robe.</p>
<p>The Doge now dismissed the barbers and endeavoured afresh to make
love to the bride, who feigned coyness and said that she feared that
they both would surely perish when Marko learned of what had taken
place. But the Doge protested: &ldquo;Oh do not be so foolish. I have
five hundred followers with me! Marko&rsquo;s tent stands far away.
Dost thou not see it in the distance? On its top is fixed a golden
apple. In the apple are placed two large <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The maiden pretended that she wished to have a clear
view of this wonder, and the Doge gallantly raised the hanging at the
door that she might see more clearly. The next moment she was running
swiftly as a deer toward Prince Marko&rsquo;s pavilion.</p>

</div>
<p>Marko was sleeping, and was greatly astonished when suddenly he was
awakened by the entrance of his unexpected visitor. When he recognized
in the maiden his future wife he addressed her angrily: &ldquo;Thou
maiden of low birth! Is it seemly that thou shouldst visit me contrary
to all our Christian customs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden bowed low and replied: &ldquo;O my Lord, thou Royal
Prince Marko! I am not a girl of low birth, but of most noble lineage.
Thou hast brought with thee guests of most evil dispositions. Know
then, that my leader Styepan Zemlyitch sold me, thy bride, to the Doge
of Venice for three bootfuls of gold! If thou canst not believe this,
look! Here is the Doge&rsquo;s beard!&rdquo; and she unfastened her
robe and took out the Doge&rsquo;s beard and showed it to him.</p>
<p>Marko&rsquo;s wrath was now directed against his perfidious friends,
and at break of day, wrapping himself in his wolf-skin cloak, and
taking his heavy mace, he went straight to the bride&rsquo;s leader and
to the koom, saying: &ldquo;Good morning to ye, O bride&rsquo;s leader
and koom! Thou leader, where is thy sister-in-law? And thou, O koom,
where is thy kooma?&rdquo; Styepan Zemlyitch kept as silent as a stone,
but the Doge said: &ldquo;O thou Royal Prince Marko! There are such
strange people about that one cannot even make a joke without being
misunderstood!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Marko answered: &ldquo;Ill is thy joke, O thou Doge of Venice!
Where is thy beard? It is a very strange joke to shave one&rsquo;s
beard!&rdquo; The Doge would have answered, but before he could do so
Prince Marko had unsheathed his sabre and cleft his head in twain.</p>
<p>Styepan Zemlyitch attempted to escape, but Marko rushed after him
and struck him so neatly with his keen sabre that he fell to earth in
two pieces.</p>
<p>This done, Marko returned to his tent, ordered the procession to
advance, and arrived without mishap at Prilip.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day the mother of Prince Marko spoke thus to her
son: &ldquo;O, my darling son, thou Royal Prince Marko! Why dost thou
erect so many churches and shrines? Either thou hast sinned gravely
before God and thou art in lowly penance, or thou must have piled
somewhere superabundant wealth?&rdquo; Then Marko of Prilip answered
her: &ldquo;My beloved, aged mother! I will tell thee the truth. Once
while I travelled through the Moorish country I rose early one morning
in order to go and refresh my Sharatz at the well. When I arrived there
I found twelve Moors who had come for the same purpose, and, as I, in
my pride, would not await my turn, the twelve Moors opposed me because
they had come first. At once we began to quarrel. I lifted my heavy
club and felled one of the Moors, to the earth; his companions attacked
me and I struck another to the ground; ten assailed me and I killed a
third; nine engaged me and a fourth bit the dust; the other eight
rushed on me and I knocked down the fifth; seven strove with me and I
sent to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>eternity the sixth; but I had to face the
remaining six, who overpowered me; they bound my arms to my back and
carried me to their Sultan, who flung me in prison. There I dwelt for
eight years knowing nothing of the seasons, save that in winter girls
would play with snow-balls and sometimes fling them through my prison
bars, wherefore I knew that it was winter; or maidens flung me bunches
of basil, and thus I knew when it was early summer.<span class="corr"

<p class="first">&ldquo;When the eighth year broke upon me, it was not
my dungeon that distressed me so much as a Moorish maiden, the beloved
daughter of the Sultan. She annoyed me by coming every morning and
every evening and calling to me through my dungeon-window: &lsquo;Why
shouldst thou perish in this prison, O Marko? Give me thy word that
thou art willing to marry me and I will release thee, and thy Sharatz
too, I would take with me, also, heaps of golden ducats; as much, O
Mark, as thou canst ever wish to have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time I was in very great misery and despair, O my
mother, and so taking off my cap and placing it upon my knee I
addressed it thus: &lsquo;By my firm faith! I shall never abandon thee;
neither shall I ever forget thee, upon my soul! The sun itself has
often changed, shining not in winter as in summer, but my promise shall
be unbroken for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maiden believed, in pleasant delusion, that I had sworn
faithfulness to her, and so at dusk one evening she opened the doors of
my prison, led me along to my spirited Sharatz, having got ready for
herself a fine noble charger. Both steeds bore on their backs bags
filled with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>ducats. The Moorish maiden brought in addition
my best tempered sabre and we sped swiftly through the Moorish
lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When darkness came upon us and I flung myself on the ground
to slumber, the Moorish princess did likewise, and lo! she threw her
arms around me. And I looked at her, O my mother, and I saw how black
her face was and how white were her teeth! I shuddered with horror and
hardly knowing what I did, I sprang to my feet, mounted my Sharatz, and
galloped away madly, leaving her alone. The maiden called after me in
anguish: &lsquo;O my brother-in-God, thou Royal Prince Marko! Leave me
not thus!&rsquo; But I would not stay my flight.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2764" class="main">PRINCE MARKO AND THE VEELA</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Prince Marko and Milosh of Potzerye rode early one
morning across the beauteous mountain Mirotch, carrying their lances
and trotting their steeds. They loved each other so dearly that they
would now and then embrace. Suddenly Marko began to doze on his
Sharatz, and tried to persuade his companion to sing something in order
to keep him awake. Thereupon Milosh answered: &ldquo;O dear
brother-in-God, thou Royal Prince Marko! I would gladly sing a song for
thee, but last night when I was with veela Raviyoyla, I drank far too
much wine, and she threatened, in truth she promised, to pierce both my
heart and my throat with arrows if she ever heard me sing
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Marko insisted: &ldquo;Oh do sing, brother dear! Fear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>not the veela as long as I, Prince Marko, live;
and as long as I have Sharatz and my six-edged club!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Milosh to please his pobratim, began to sing a beautiful song
telling of their valiant and virtuous ancestors; how they had held
kingdoms and ruled in succession over the much-honoured land of
Macedonia; and how every one of those good sovereigns had erected a
shrine or a church.</p>
<p>The song pleased Marko so much that, lulled by Milosh&rsquo;s
melodious voice, he fell asleep. But it happened that the veela also
heard the song, and began to sing in turn with Milosh, doing all the
time her very best to show him that she sang better than he did. Milosh
really sang better, for he possessed a magnificent voice, and this fact
much irritated the veela; she took two slim arrows, twanged her bow,
and transfixed first Milosh&rsquo;s throat and then his heart.</p>
<p>Milosh uttered a piercing cry: &ldquo;Alas, O my mother! Alas,
Marko, my brother-in-God! The veela has shot me with her arrows! Did I
not tell thee, O pobratim, that I must not sing on the mountain
Mirotch?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2779" class="main">The Pursuit of the Veela</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This lamentation awoke Marko at once. He leaped
lightly from the saddle, tightly fastened his Sharatz&rsquo;s girths,
embraced him, and thus whispered in his ear: &ldquo;Lo, <i>Sharo</i>,
thou on whom I depend for speed! Oh, thou must overtake, now, the veela
Raviyoyla; and I shall shoe thy hoofs with pure silver and gild them
with the finest gold; I shall cover thee with a silken cloak reaching
to thy knees, and on it I shall fasten fine silk tassels to hang from
thy knees to thy hoofs; thy mane shall I intertwine with threads of
gold and adorn it with rare pearls. But, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>woe to thee if thou
reachest not the veela! Both thy eyes shall I tear out; thy four legs
shall I break; and I shall abandon thee here and thou shalt for ever
creep from one fir-tree to another, exactly as I should do if I lost my
dear brother Milosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Marko sprang upon Sharatz, and rode swiftly after the veela.
Raviyoyla was already flying over the mountain top, and when Sharatz
caught sight of her he bounded fiercely forward, leaping to the height
of three lances in the air, and covering the length of four lances at
each bound. In a few moments Sharatz came up with the veela, who,
greatly affrighted, flew upward to the clouds. But Marko pitilessly
hurled his far-reaching club and struck her between the white
shoulders, and she fell instantly to the earth. Marko struck her
several times as she lay on the earth, exclaiming: &ldquo;O Veela! May
God requite thee! Why didst thou pierce my dear pobratim&rsquo;s throat
and heart? Thou hadst better give him healing herbs, else thou shalt
not carry thy head much longer upon thy shoulders!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">In a few moments Sharatz came up with the
veela</p>
</div>
<p>The veela implored Marko to forgive her, and to become her
brother-in-God. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, O my brother Marko, and by
the memory of St. John,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;spare my life, and I
will go through the mountain and gather herbs to heal thy
pobratim&rsquo;s wounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko was very easily moved by the mention of the divine&rsquo;s
name, and he released the veela, who went at once, but never out of
hearing and answering to Marko&rsquo;s frequent calls.</p>
<p>When the veela had collected herbs she brought them to Milosh and
healed his wounds; his voice was not only quite restored, but it was
finer than before and his heart was sounder. Then the brothers-in-God
rode straight to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>the district of Poretch, where they crossed
the River Timok, and soon arrived at the town of Bregovo, whence, after
tarrying awhile, they departed to the district of Vidin. When the veela
rejoined her sisters she admonished them, saying: &ldquo;Hark, ye
veelas, my sisters! Do not shoot any heroes in the mountains with your
bows and arrows, so long as the Royal Prince Marko and his Sharatz are
alive. Oh, what I, much to be pitied, have suffered at his hands
to-day! I marvel, indeed, that I still live!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2804" class="main">PRINCE MARKO AND THE TURKISH
HUNTSMEN</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Amouradh, the grand Vizir once arranged a hunting
party of twelve Turkish warriors to which he also invited Prince Marko.
They hunted for three days and found nothing in the mountain-forest.
But, behold! they suddenly discovered a green-bosomed lake upon which a
team of wild ducks was swimming! The Vizir let loose his falcon and
bade him pounce upon a gold-winged duck, but the duck did not even
allow the falcon to see it, so swiftly it flew toward the clouds; as
for the falcon it fell on the branches of a fir-tree.</p>
<p>Then Prince Marko spoke thus to the Vizir: &ldquo;Am I permitted, O
Vizir Amouradh, to release my falcon and try to secure the gold-winged
duck?&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely you may, Prince Marko,&rdquo; answered the
Vizir. Then the princely Marko let loose his falcon, and the bird
ascended to the clouds, sprang upon the gold-winged prey, and bore it
down to the foot of the green fir-tree.</p>
<p>When Amouradh&rsquo;s falcon saw this it became greatly excited and,
according to its natural habit of seizing others&rsquo; spoil, it
turned violently upon its rival and tried to pluck the duck from its
claws. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Marko&rsquo;s falcon was exceedingly valiant, worthy of its
master, and would yield its well-earned trophy to none but its master.
So it turned sharply on Amouradh&rsquo;s falcon and vehemently tore at
its proud feathers.</p>
<p>When the Vizir saw this, he too became excited and in great rage
rushed to the combatants and flung Prince Marko&rsquo;s falcon fiercely
against a fir-tree so that its right wing was broken. He then took
horse with his followers and fled from the scene of his violence.</p>
<p>The noble falcon, as it lay upon the ground, wailed in its pain and
Prince Marko ran quickly and caught it to his breast, for he loved it
very dearly. Then very tenderly he bound its wounded pinion and
addressed the bird with emotion: &ldquo;Woe to me and to thee, my
falcon, that ever we went hunting with the Turk without our dear
Serbians, for the Turk must ever violate the rights of
others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having bound his falcon&rsquo;s wing, Marko sprang upon
Sharatz and sped through the forest swift as a veela. Soon he left the
mountain behind and he observed the fleeing Turks in front of him. The
Vizir turned in his saddle and saw Marko in the distance, wherefore he
spoke thus to his twelve valiant companions: &ldquo;Ye, my children, ye
twelve valiant heroes! See ye yonder mountain-mist approaching, and in
it the Royal Prince Marko? Hark! how fiercely he enrages his Sharatz!
God alone knows, what will befall us!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2823" class="main">The Vengeance of Marko</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He had barely uttered these words when Prince Marko
came up flourishing his bright sabre. Instantly the twelve Turks
dispersed like a flock of sparrows startled by a vulture. Marko made
for the Vizir and with one thrust of his sabre cleft his head asunder.
Next he pursued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>the twelve Turkish warriors, each of whom
he cut in two, striking them through their Turkish sashes. Then he
stood for a while in doubt: &ldquo;Oh, what am I to do now? Ought I to
go to the Sultan at Yedrenet or had I perhaps better return to my white
castle at Prilip?&rdquo; After long thought he decided that it would be
far better to go to the Sultan and give an account of what had happened
than to give an opportunity to his foes to calumniate him to the
Padishah.</p>
<p>When Prince Marko arrived at Yedrenet he was at once received in
divan by the Sultan.</p>
<p>A poet describes Marko&rsquo;s eyes as being as bright and fierce as
those of a hungry wolf; and the Sultan was terrified by the lightning
flashing from his eyes. He deemed it well to temporize and so spoke
gently to the hero: &ldquo;O my dear son Marko, why art thou so enraged
to-day? Art thou, perchance, short of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Marko narrated to the Sultan what had happened to his Vizir
Amouradh, not omitting to mention one single incident. When he had
heard the tale, the Sultan, convulsed with laughter, comforted Prince
Marko: &ldquo;May Blessings fall upon thee, my dearest son
Marko!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If thou hadst not behaved thus, I would
no longer call thee a son of mine; any Turk may become Vizir, but there
is no hero to equal Marko!&rdquo; With these words the Sultan plunged
his hand in his silk-lined pocket, drew out a purse containing one
thousand ducats and proffered it to Prince Marko, exclaiming:
&ldquo;Accept this as a gift from me, O my dearest son Marko, take some
wine and go in peace!&rdquo; Marko, nothing loth, accepted the purse
and left the divan.</p>
<p>The Sultan, however, was not moved to this seeming generosity by
friendliness to Marko; on the contrary he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

exceedingly and was anxious only for his speedy departure.</p>

drinking wine in a white tavern in Istamboul. Presently, when he had
drunk a good deal he began to talk thus: &lsquo;It is just about nine
years since I entered the service of the Sultan at Istamboul, yet he
has never given me a horse, or arms, or even a velvet cloak! By my
faith, I shall rebel! I shall go down to the coast, seize the harbours
and all the roads leading to them: and then build myself a koula,
around which I shall erect gibbets with iron hooks and hang his
<i>hodjas</i> (priests) and <i>hadjis</i> (pilgrims) upon
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threats the Albanian made in his drunkenness he actually carried
out when he became possessed of his senses. He turned rebel, seized the
sea-ports and the main roads, captured and robbed the rich merchants,
and hanged the Sultan&rsquo;s hodjas and hadjis. When the Sultan heard
of all these misdeeds, he sent the Grand Vizir Tyouprilitch with three
thousand men to undertake a campaign against Moussa. But, alas! no
sooner had the Turkish army reached the sea-coast than Moussa dispersed
it and took the Grand Vizir prisoner. Next he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>bound the Vizir hand and foot and sent him back
thus ignominiously to his master at Istamboul.</p>
<p>Now the Sultan, in despair, published a proclamation all over his
vast empire, promising untold riches to any knight who would vanquish
the rebel. And many a brave knight went to fight the rebel, but, alas!
not one ever returned to Istamboul to claim the promised gold! This
humiliation threw the Sultan into unspeakable distress and anxiety.</p>
<p>At length the Grand Vizir Tyouprilitch came to him and said:
&ldquo;Sire, thou Glorious Sultan! If only we had now with us the Royal
Prince Marko! He would surely overcome Moussa the Bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan cast at his Vizir a reproachful glance, and, with tears
in his eyes, said: &ldquo;Oh, torture not my soul, by speaking of the
princely knight Marko! His very bones must have rotted long before this
day, for at least three years have flown since I threw him into my
darkest dungeon, the door of which has remained fast bolted.&rdquo;
Thereupon the Vizir asked: &ldquo;Gracious master, what wouldst thou
give to the man who could bring Marko into thy presence alive?&rdquo;
And the mighty Sultan answered: &ldquo;I would give him the vizirate of
Bosnia, with power there to remain for nine years without recall, and I
would not demand from him even a <i>dinar</i> of the revenues and taxes
which he might collect.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Hearing this, the cunning Vizir hastened to the
prison, opened the door of the dungeon, brought out the Royal Prince
Marko and led him before the Sultan. Marko&rsquo;s hair had grown to
the ground, one-half of it he had used to sleep upon, and with the
other part he covered himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>at night; his nails were so
long that he could plough with them; the dampness and dirt in the
dungeon had changed him so that he was as black as a black stone.</p>
<p>When the Sultan saw him, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Dost thou still live,
Marko?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yea, I am still alive, but hardly can I move my
limbs,&rdquo; the hero answered.</p>
<p>And the Sultan went on to tell Marko about the evil doings of
Moussa, and asked him: &ldquo;Couldst thou undertake, O Marko, to go to
the sea-coast and kill Moussa Kessedjiya? If thou wouldst do this, I
would gladly give thee as much gold as thou canst desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Prince Marko answered: &ldquo;Alas, O Sire! The dampness
of the stone dungeon has ruined my bones and much hurt my eyes. How
could I venture to fight a duel with Moussa? But, if thou wishest me to
try that feat, place me in a good inn somewhere, supply me with plenty
of wine and brandy, fat mutton and good white bread, that I may perhaps
regain my strength. I shall then tell thee as soon as I feel myself
able to fight a duel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the Sultan summoned attendants to wash Marko, to cut
his hair, to shave him and to trim his nails. Then he had him conducted
with honour to the New Inn, where there was abundance of everything to
satisfy his needs.</p>
<p>Marko remained in the inn for three months, zealously eating and
drinking, and he had thus considerably restored his strength, when the
Sultan asked him: &ldquo;Dost thou yet feel thyself able to go and
overcome Moussa, for my poor subjects are incessantly sending me
complaints against that accursed brigand?&rdquo; And Marko answered the
Sultan thus: &ldquo;Let a piece of perfectly dry wood of a medlar-tree,
which has been cut off nine years be brought to me, that I may test my
strength!&rdquo; When the piece of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>wood was brought, Marko took
it in his right hand and squeezed it so hard that it broke in three.
&ldquo;By my faith, Sire, it is not yet time for me to venture a duel
with such a dangerous adversary as Moussa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Marko remained in the New Inn for another month, eating,
drinking, and resting, till he felt a little stronger. Then he asked
again for a dry stick from a medlar-tree. When the wood was brought to
him, he squeezed it with his right hand till it broke in pieces, and
this time two drops of water came from it. Then Marko said to the
Sultan: &ldquo;Sire, now I am ready to fight the duel.&rdquo;</p>

thirty ducats and went back to the inn. There he stayed to drink red
wine for the next few days, and then went again to the smith&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Hast thou finished my sword, O Novak?&rdquo; And the swordsmith
brought forth the blade and gave it to Marko, who asked: &ldquo;Is it
good?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is the sword and here is the anvil; thou
canst try on it the quality of thy sword!&rdquo; answered Novak
timidly. Thereupon Marko lifted his sword and struck the anvil with it
so hard that he cut right through it. &ldquo;O Novak, the swordsmith,
tell me now, truthfully&mdash;and may God help thee&mdash;hast thou
ever made a better sword?&rdquo; And Novak answered: &ldquo;Since thou
didst call upon the name of the true God, I must tell thee truthfully

warrior. When Moussa turned rebel and went to the sea-coast, he ordered

<p>This enraged Marko. &ldquo;Hold out thy hand, Novak, that I may pay
thee for my sword!&rdquo; No sooner had the man stretched forth his
right arm, than Marko by a swift stroke cut it off from the shoulder.
&ldquo;Now, O Novak, from this day thou shalt not make either a better
or a worse sword than mine! And take these hundred ducats as thy
reward!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2911" class="main">Marko meets Moussa</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then Marko mounted his Sharatz and rode off to the
sea, seeking and inquiring all the way for Moussa. One morning early he
rode up the defile Katchanik, when suddenly he saw Moussa Kessedjiya,
calmly seated on his black steed with his legs crossed, throwing his
mace to the clouds and catching it again in his right hand. When the
two knights met, Marko said to Moussa: &ldquo;Knightly Moussa, move
aside and leave the path free for my Sharatz to pass! Move aside or bow
before me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Moussa answered: &ldquo;Pass on quietly, Marko, do not start
a quarrel. Better still, let us dismount and take refreshment together.
I shall never move aside to make way for thee. I know well that thou
wert born of a queen in a palace, and wert laid upon silken cushions.
Doubtless thy mother wrapped thee in pure silk, and fastened the silk
with golden thread, and gave thee honey and sugar; my mother was a
poor, wild Albanian, and I was born on the cold rocks near the sheep
she was tending, and she wrapped me in a rough, black cloth, tying it
on to me with bramble twigs; she fed me on oatmeal&mdash;but above all
things she always made me swear that I should never move aside for
anybody.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hearing this, Marko of Prilip aimed his lance at Moussa&rsquo;s
breast, but the fierce Albanian received it on his warrior-mace, and it
glanced off, whizzing high above his head. Then Moussa threw his own
lance, aiming at Marko&rsquo;s breast, but the princely hero received
it on his club and it broke in three. They next unsheathed their swords
and attacked each other at close quarters. Marko gave a great stroke,
but Moussa interposed his mace and the sword was shattered. Instantly
Moussa raised his own sword to strike his adversary, but Marko, in the
like manner, received it upon his club and the weapon snapped in two
near its hilt. Then they began labouring each other with their maces
until these broke too. They next dismounted and seized each other
fiercely. The famous heroes were equally matched for once, the knightly
Moussa against the princely Marko. Moussa could neither throw Marko
down, nor could Marko overcome Moussa. For a whole summer&rsquo;s
morning did they wrestle together. At about noon, white foam rose on
Moussa&rsquo;s lips, and Marko&rsquo;s lips were covered with blood and
foam. Then Moussa exclaimed: &ldquo;Do throw me down, O Marko! or, if
you cannot do it, let me throw you down!&rdquo; Marko did all he could,
but his attempts were vain. Seeing this, Moussa exerted his last
remnants of strength and, lifting Marko from the ground, he threw him
on to the grass and pressed his knees on his breast.</p>
<p>Marko, in great danger, exclaimed: &ldquo;Where art thou now, my
sister-in-God, thou Veela? Where art thou to-day, mayst thou live no
longer! Now I see thine oath was false when thou didst sware to me that
whenever I should be in distress, thou wouldst help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veela appeared from behind the clouds, saying: &ldquo;O my
brother, Royal Prince Marko! Hast thou forgotten my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>words: That thou shouldst never fight on Sunday?
I cannot help thee, for it would not be fair that two should fight
against one. Where are thy secret poniards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moussa cast a glance to the clouds to see where the voice came from,
and this was his undoing, for Marko seized the moment, drew out a
secret blade, and with a sudden fierce stroke cut Moussa so that his
body was opened from his waist to his neck.</p>
<p>Marko disengaged himself with difficulty from the embraces of the
horrible Moussa, and as the body lay upon its back the Prince
discovered through the gaping wound that his adversary had three rows
of ribs and three hearts. One of the hearts had collapsed; another was
still beating excitedly; on the third a serpent was just awaking, and
as it saw Marko it hissed: &ldquo;Praise God, O Royal Prince Marko,
that I still slept while Moussa was alive&mdash;for a three hundred
fold misfortune would surely otherwise have befallen thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marko heard this, tears poured down his cheeks and he lamented:
&ldquo;Alas! Gracious God forgive me, I have killed a better knight
than I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he struck off Moussa&rsquo;s head with his sword, put it into
Sharatz&rsquo;s nose-bag and returned triumphantly to Istamboul. When
he flung the head of Moussa before the Sultan the monarch was so
horrified that he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Do not fear the dead, O
gracious Sultan! If thou art frightened by the sight of Moussa&rsquo;s
head, what wouldst thou have done if thou hadst met him
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan gave three tovars of gold to Marko, who returned to his
castle at Prilip.</p>
<p>As for Moussa the Bully, he remained on the top of Katchanik
Mountain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=

<h3 id="xd19e2942" class="main">THE DEATH OF PRINCE MARKO</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the early dawn of a Sabbath morning Prince Marko
paced the sea-shore. Soon he came to a bridle path that led up the
slopes of the Ourvinian mountain, and as he got near to the mountain
top, his faithful Sharatz suddenly stumbled and began to shed tears.
His moans fell sadly upon Marko&rsquo;s heart and he addressed his
favourite thus: &ldquo;Alas! dear Sharo, my most precious treasure! Lo!
we have dwelt happily together these many summers as beloved
companions; till now thou hast never stumbled, and to-day for the first
time thine eyes do weep: God alone knows what fate awaits us, but I can
see that my life or thine is in great peril and that one of us is
surely doomed to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marko had spoken to his Sharatz thus, the veela from the
Ourvinian mountain called to him: &ldquo;My dear brother-in-God! O
Royal Prince Marko! Knowest thou not, brother, why thy horse is
stumbling? Thy Sharatz is grieving for thee, his master. Know that ere
long ye must be divided!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marko answered: &ldquo;O thou white veela! May thy throat cause thee
pain for speaking thus: How in this world could I ever part from
Sharatz, who through many a land and many a city hath borne me from
dawn till sunset; better steed never trod our earth than Sharatz, and
Marko never better hero. While my head is on my shoulders, never will I
be severed from my beloved steed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the veela called again: &ldquo;O my brother, Royal Prince Marko,
there is no force which can tear thy Sharatz from thee; thou canst not
die from any hero&rsquo;s shining sabre, or battle-club, or lance of
warrior; thou fearest no hero <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>on earth&mdash;but, alas!
thou must die, O Marko! Death, the ancient slayer, will smite thee. If
thou wilt not believe me, hasten to the summit of the mountain, look to
the right and to the left, and thou wilt presently see two tall
fir-trees covered with fresh green leaves and towering high above the
other trees of the forest. Between those fir-trees there is a spring;
there alight, and bind thy Sharatz to one of the fir-trees; then bend
thee down and the water will mirror thy face. Look and thou shalt see
when death awaits thee!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2955" class="main">Marko learns his Fate</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marko followed the veela&rsquo;s instruction, and when
he arrived upon the mountain top, he looked to the right and to the
left, and truly, he saw the two tall straight fir-trees just as she
described them, and he did everything she had counselled him to do.
When he looked into the spring he saw his face reflected in the water,
and lo! his fate was written on its surface!...</p>
<p>Then he shed many bitter tears, and spoke in this wise: &ldquo;O
thou treacherous world, once my fairy flower! Thou wert
lovely&mdash;but I sojourned for too short a time with thee: yea for
about three hundred years! The hour has come for me to depart!&rdquo;
Then he drew his sabre and hastened to Sharatz; with one stroke he
smote off his head. Never should he be mounted by the Turk; never
should a Turkish burden be placed upon his proud shoulders; never
should he carry the <i>dyugoom</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e2963src"
href="#xd19e2963" name="xd19e2963src">16</a> from the well for the
hated Moslem!</p>
<p>Marko now dug a grave for his faithful Sharatz and interred him with
more honour than he had buried Andreas, his own brother. Then he broke
his sabre in four that it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>might not fall into the hands of a
Moslem, and that the Turk might not brandish it with something of his
own power, lest the curse of Christendom should fall upon him. Marko
next broke his lance in seven pieces throwing the fragments into the
branches of the fir-tree. Then he took his terrible club in his right
hand, and swiftly flung it from the Ourvinian mountain far into the
dark sapphire sea, with the words: &ldquo;When my club returns from the
depths of the ocean, then shall come a hero as great as Marko!&rdquo;
When he had scattered thus all his weapons, he drew from his belt a
golden tablet upon which he inscribed this message: &ldquo;To him who
passes over this mountain, and to him who seeks the spring by the
fir-trees and finds Marko&rsquo;s body: know that Marko is dead. There
are here three purses filled with golden ducats. One shall be
Marko&rsquo;s gift to him who digs his grave: the second shall be used
to adorn churches; the gold in the third shall be distributed among the
blind and maimed, that they may wander in peace through the land and
with hymns laud Marko&rsquo;s deeds and feats of glory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marko had thus written he bound the tablet to a branch that it
might be seen by the passers-by. He spread his cloak on the grass
beneath the fir-trees, made the sign of the holy cross, drew over his
eyes his fur cap and laid himself down....</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The body of Marko lay beside the spring day after day
till a whole week had passed. Meanwhile many a traveller passed over
the broad path and saw the knightly Marko, but one and all believed him
to be slumbering and kept a safe distance, fearing to disturb or awake
the sleeping hero. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>Fortune is the leader of misfortune, as
misfortune often leads to fortune: and it befell that Vasso the
<i>igouman</i> (abbot) of Mount Athos, rode that way from the white
church Vilindar attended by the youthful Issaya his deacon. When the
igouman noticed Marko, he beckoned to Issaya. &ldquo;O my son,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;be cautious, lest thou wake the hero, for Marko is
furious when disturbed and may destroy us both.&rdquo; Then he looked
anxiously round and saw the inscription which Marko had fixed above his
head. He drew near cautiously and read the message. Then he dismounted
hastily from his horse and seized Marko&rsquo;s hand&mdash;but the hero
moved not! Tears rushed from the eyes of Vasso, and he lamented loudly
the fate of Marko. After a time he took the three purses from the
hero&rsquo;s girdle and hid them beneath his belt. Long he pondered as
to where he should entomb Marko; at length he placed the hero&rsquo;s
body on his horse and brought it to the shore. In due course he arrived
safely with it at the white church Vilindar, and having sung the
customary hymns and performed those rites which are fitting he interred
Marko&rsquo;s body beneath the centre of the church.</p>

instrument which emits droning monotonous sounds, and which resembles
in many points the hurdy-gurdy. In olden times, in Serbia, this

men played the flute, violin, and a kind of bagpipes.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e2224" href="#xd19e2224src" name="xd19e2224">2</a></span> In order
to illustrate how firmly rooted is that belief throughout Serbia, the
author quotes from his article (condensed): &ldquo;How a Fourteenth
Century Serbian Prince achieved a Miraculous Victory in the Late
War,&rdquo; <i>The International Psychic Gazette</i>, May 1913.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;... When we arrived on the 15th of November
last year, at Skoplye (Uskub), the Serbian officers gave a
comparatively sumptuous banquet at their barracks in honour of
Surgeon-General Bourke and the two units of the British Red Cross, on
which occasion the aged General Mishitch related to us the following
incident from the battle of Prilip, fought a few days previously.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;... Our infantry was ordered to make a
forced march on the eve of that battle, which is unique in the history
of warfare. They were to wait at the foot of the mount of Prilip on
which stood the Castle of Marko for the effect of our artillery, which
was superior both in numbers and quality to that of the Turks. They
were especially cautioned against storming the fort before they
received the order from their commander-in-chief. This was necessary,
for our soldiers had won recently several battles at the point of the
bayonet, and were convinced that there was nothing that would frighten
the Turks more than the sight of the shining bayonets of the Serbian
troops. They knew well that the mere exclamation of Bulgarians, <i>Na
noge!</i> put the Turks to flight at Kirk-Kliss&eacute; and
L&uuml;l&eacute; Bourgass.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;During the early morning the infantry kept
quiet, but at the first cannon-shots we noticed an effervescence among
our troops, and soon afterward we heard them shouting frantically and
saw them running like wolves straight to the castle of the Royal Prince
Marko. I could hear the voice of our Captain Agatonovitch, commanding
them to stop and await the General&rsquo;s order. When the immediate
commanders saw that discipline proved futile, they essayed in vain to
appeal to the soldiers&rsquo; reason, assuring them of certain death if
they would not await at least the effect of our artillery. Our
warriors, deafened by the roaring of the Turkish siege-cannon and
mitrailleuses, ran straight into the fire, and appeared to fall in
dozens! The sight was horrible. I was unable to stop my soldiers. My
blood froze, I closed my eyes. Disastrous defeat! Demoralisation of
other troops! My own degradation was certain!</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;In a little while our artillery ceased
firing, lest they should kill their own comrades, who were now crossing
bayonets with the Turkish infantry. A few minutes later we saw the
Serbian national colours fluttering on the donjon of Kralyevitch
Marko&rsquo;s castle. The Turks were fleeing in greatest disorder. The
Serbian victory was as complete as it was rapid!</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;When we arrived on the scene a little later,
a parade was ordered. After calling together the troops we found our
loss had been comparatively insignificant. I praised my heroes for
their brave conduct, but reproached them bitterly for their
disobedience. At my last admonishing words, I heard from thousands of
soldiers in majestic unison:</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Kralyevitch Marko commanded us all
the time: FORWARD! Did you not see him on his Sharatz?</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;It was clear to me that the tradition of
Kralyevitch Marko was so deeply engraved on the hearts of those honest
and heroic men that, in their vivid enthusiasm, they had seen the
incarnation of their hero.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;I dismissed the troops and ordered double
portions of food and wine to be given to all for a week. Every tenth
man obtained a &lsquo;<i lang="sr">Medalya za Hrabrost</i>&rsquo;
(medal for courage).&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2997" class="main">Historical Data</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ballad relating to Banovitch Strahinya is one of
the finest and most famous which the anonymous Serbian bards composed
during the Middle Ages. The author was probably a dependent of the
descendants of Banovitch, and utilized a few historical and
biographical data, which he must have found among the manuscripts and
other records belonging to his lord or in the other castles he visited
from time to time.</p>
<p>Prince Ourosh (of the Nemanya dynasty) married Helen, a French
princess of the house de Courtenay, and through her he kept up friendly
relations with the French Court of Charles of Anjou in Naples, and he
endeavoured to negotiate an alliance between Serbs and French for the
<span class="corr" id="xd19e3003" title=
"Source: otherthrow">overthrow</span> and partition of the Byzantine
Empire.</p>
<p>Some Serbian historians believe that Banovitch Strahinya was really
the glorious Strashimir Balshitch-Nemanyitch (who reigned conjointly
with his two brothers from 1360&ndash;1370 in Skadar, the capital of
Northern Albania) and a descendant of the old Proven&ccedil;al family
of des Baux.</p>
<p>In early local records the name Baux is latinized Balcius, and
members of the family who attended the Court at Naples changed the
name, in Italian fashion, into Balza. And it is supposed that these
Italianized Seigneurs des Baux, who were permitted to marry into the
Royal House of Nemanyitch, and who settled in Serbian lands, then
further changed their patronymic to Balsha or
Balshitch&mdash;<i>itch</i>, or <i>ich</i>, or <i>i&#263;</i> being the
characteristic termination of most Serbian family names.</p>
<p>It may here be stated that Skadar was at that time still
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>the capital of Zeta (the Montenegro of modern
times). The valiant Nicholas I Petrovitch, the present King of
Montenegro, and an indirect descendant out of Balshitch, was obliged by
the Great Powers to evacuate the town after he had obtained possession
of it by the heroism of his troops, and Serbian bards throughout the
kingdom are now improvising ballads, in which they may transmit to
future generations the story of the sad events of the present time,
just as their ancestors recorded the exploits of Strahinya. But let us
turn to the story of Banovitch as it was given in the old ballad.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3024" class="main">The Falcon Banovitch</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the opening verses the bard describes the hero and
eulogizes him as &ldquo;a falcon without equal.&rdquo; He tells of the
orders given by Banovitch to his servants and pages relative to the
preparations to be made for himself, Dyogo his faithful steed, and the
greyhound Caraman, his inseparable companion. He is not going to the
hunt, however; he intends to visit the aged Youg Bogdan, and is clad in
pure silk and velvet embroidered with fine gold. Bogdan, his beloved
father-in-law, resides at his sumptuous castle in Kroushevatz. The old
man rejoiced to see him, and his nine sons and their wives, as well as
Bogdan&rsquo;s sons-in-law, of whom one was a direct descendant of King
Nemanya, greeted him warmly.</p>
<p>As they were feasting, a letter was brought from Banovitch&rsquo;s
mother, telling him that innumerable hordes of Turks had encamped on
the field of Kossovo. Strahinya seized the letter and read in horror
his mother&rsquo;s malediction: &ldquo;Woe to thee and thy feasting in
the accursed castle of thy wife&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; The letter went
on to say that a certain chieftain named Vlah-Ali, proud, haughty,

Vizir, but of Sultan Amourath himself, had attacked, conquered, and
pillaged his castle, captured his servants, and taken his wife away to
his tent on a mountain near the field of Kossovo, where she was
seemingly quite content to remain. Youg Bogdan, observing
Strahinya&rsquo;s grief, asked him in alarm what was amiss, if he
lacked anything in his castle, or if any one of his family had offended
him. Banovitch thanked his father-in-law, and assured him that other
misfortunes were troubling him, and he read the letter aloud. Banovitch
then begged Youg Bogdan to allow his sons to accompany him to the field
of Kossovo, as he had resolved to rescue his wife from the hands of the
foe. But Youg Bogdan, thinking that it would be foolish for so few to
go and face the many thousands of bloodthirsty Turks, disapproved
altogether of this, and strongly advised Banovitch to abandon the idea.
He even promised to find him a bride fairer and more worthy of him than
his own faithless daughter. But Strahinya remained unshaken in his
resolution, and convinced of his father-in-law&rsquo;s lack of
chivalry, ran hurriedly to the stables, refusing in scorn the help of
Bogdan&rsquo;s servants, saddled Dyogo, and indignant and sorrowful
mounted forthwith. As he was riding out of the courtyard he suddenly
remembered Caraman, so he whistled, and instantly Caraman ran to his
master and comforted him.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3033" class="main">Banovitch seeks the Turk</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So over fields and over mountains, straight to
Kossovo, Banovitch rode forth with courage and gladness, for his dog
was even dearer to him than his steed. At Kossovo he saw the plain
crowded with tents and soldiers, and as he looked he felt something
like dread within him; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>nevertheless, he called on the
name of the true God and taking the precaution of disguising himself as
a Turk, he rode over the plain. For several days he sought, but alas!
in vain, the tent of Vlah-Ali. At last from the banks of Sitnitza, he
beheld a spacious green tent upon the pole of which a golden apple
shone; before the entrance stood an Arab steed stamping sharply with
his forefeet upon the ground. Strahinya thought that this must surely
be the tent of Vlah-Ali, and he fiercely spurred on his Dyogo. Reaching
the tent in a moment, spear in hand, he boldly drew aside the silken
curtain which veiled the entrance. To his disappointment he saw that
the only occupant of the pavilion was an old dervish with a white beard
reaching to his knees. The old man was drinking wine, a thing forbidden
to him by the laws of his order, and he returned the greeting of
Strahinya, who spoke good Turkish, with a profound salaam. Then, to
Strahinya&rsquo;s astonishment, the dervish said: &ldquo;Hail! O
Banovitch Strahinya, Lord of Little Banyska near Kossovo!&rdquo;
Banovitch was taken aback, but he tried to put a good face upon it and
asked in apparent surprise: &ldquo;Who is the man thou hast called
Banovitch Strahinya?&rdquo; The half-drunken dervish laughed aloud.
&ldquo;Thou canst not deceive me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would
instantly recognize thee, yea, even wert thou on the top of the
mountain Goletch.&rdquo; Then he told Banovitch how that he had been a
captive in his castle a few years <span class="corr" id="xd19e3039"
title="Source: proviously">previously</span>, and had been treated most
humanely, even receiving a daily measure of wine. Finally Banovitch had
let him go to his estates to collect his ransom. Upon reaching his home
he discovered that his estates had been appropriated by the Sultan, and
his house and other possessions had been given to Pashas&rsquo;
daughters as dowries. All was dreariness and desolation; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>he
had lost his fortune&mdash;and, he added bitterly, consequently all his
friends&mdash;so he was reduced to ride to Yedrenet<a class="noteref"
id="xd19e3044src" href="#xd19e3044" name="xd19e3044src">1</a> to offer
his services to the Sultan. The Vizir, he continued, told the Sultan
that he looked as if he might quite likely be of use as a soldier,
whereupon the Sultan had given him good clothes and better weapons and
the Vizir added his name to the roll of warriors sworn to fight for the
Sultan. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I do not possess so
much as even a dinar, give me, I pray thee, time for my fortunes to
improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strahinya was deeply touched by the dervish&rsquo;s misfortunes and,
alighting from his steed, he embraced him and spoke to him in the
following friendly manner: &ldquo;Thou art my brother-in-God! I forgive
thee gladly thy ransom, neither shall I ever ask even a dinar from
thee, but thou canst repay me! I am now seeking the haughty Vlah-Ali,
who demolished my castle and robbed me of my wife. Tell me, O aged
dervish! Where shall I find my foe? I beseech thee as my
brother-in-God, not to let the Turks know of my presence here, and not
to suffer them to take me by guile.&rdquo; The dervish was glad to
become brother-in-God of such a valiant hero as Strahinya, and he
pledged his unalterable faith that, even if Strahinya should destroy
half of the Sultan&rsquo;s army, he would never betray him; but at the
same time, he tried to persuade Banovitch to give up all intention of
attacking such an unconquerable and terrible foe, whose mere name was
enough to strike terror into the heart of the best and bravest. He went
on to describe the warlike character of the invincible rebel of the
Padishah, and finished by assuring Banovitch that neither his sharp
sword, nor his poisoned spear, nor his steed would avail to protect
him, for the terrible Vlah-Ali <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>would surely seize him alive
in his iron grasp, break his limbs to pieces and pluck out his
eyes.</p>
<p>Strahinya laughed aloud when he heard all this; &ldquo;O my
brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou aged dervish! Thou needest not
warn me against one warrior, only do not bring upon me the
Sultan&rsquo;s whole army! Since thou goest to water thy horses every
evening and every morning at the River Sitnitza, thou must know where
the fords are, and thou couldst save me from riding my steed into muddy
depths!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the dervish repeated his oath, and exclaimed:</p>
<div lang="sr" class="lgouter">

<p class="first">Banovitch crossed the river, and rode without haste to
mount Goletch. He was still at the foot of the mountain when the
morning sun shone out upon the field of Kossovo, making the tents and
the soldiers&rsquo; armour gleam.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3068" class="main">The Faithless Wife</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What was the mighty Vlah-Ali doing when dawn came? The
Turk&rsquo;s custom was to seek slumber only at sunrise. &ldquo;How
very dear to him was his new slave, Strahinya&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo;
recites the bard, &ldquo;may be understood when I tell that he had
closed his eyes with his head on her ivory shoulder.&rdquo; The
faithless woman was not sleeping; through the door of the tent she
gazed over the sleeping camp. Suddenly she roused her new lord and
pointed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>terror to the figure of an advancing horseman in
whom she had recognized her true husband.</p>
<p>At first the Turk laughed at her fears and said that it was only an
ambassador from the Sultan. &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, composing
himself again to rest, &ldquo;Strahinya will not dare to come near the
tent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently his companion again roused Vlah-Ali and told him that the
horseman was no messenger from Amouradh, but her own husband, Banovitch
Strahinya himself, and she warned Vlah-Ali that he was in peril of his
life.</p>
<p>Upon this, the mighty Vlah-Ali leapt to his feet, girded on a long
silken sash, fastened in it a sharp gleaming yataghan, quickly belted
on his shining sabre, and was soon firmly seated in his saddle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd19e3080" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3081" class="main">The Combat</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A moment later Banovitch came up, and a fearful
contest began between the two champions&mdash;heroes of almost equal
renown, though not equal in strength. Strahinya addressed his opponent
with reproachful and taunting words, and Vlah-Ali replied in equally
offensive terms. But they did not fight only with words. Banovitch
spurred Dyogo and furiously cast his spear, which the mighty Turk,
stretching out his hands, caught and broke into pieces. &ldquo;O
Strahinya,&rdquo; he shouted derisively, &ldquo;thou callest me a
poltroon, indeed! Dost thou know to whom thou didst speak? Here is no
woman of thy Serbian land whom thy threats might alarm; thou hast here
to deal with the mighty Vlah-Ali who fears neither the Sultan nor his
Grand Vizir, yea, not even the countless horde which they command! One
and all, they are to me but a swarm of ants!&rdquo; Speaking thus, he
alertly reined in his sturdy horse and sent his spear whistling through
the air. So <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>straight it went to Strahinya&rsquo;s breast
that he surely would have been stricken had the just God not helped
him. Dyogo, accustomed to duels, knelt swiftly in the nick of time, so
that the Turk&rsquo;s weapon flew over Banovitch&rsquo;s head and
struck against a rock behind him, breaking into three pieces. Their
spears being thus destroyed, the fierce warriors next grasped their
heavy clubs, and rushed to close quarters. Their blows fell thick and
fast until Vlah-Ali struck Strahinya so violently that he was stunned
and fell forward upon Dyogo&rsquo;s neck. Again the true God stood by
Strahinya; his beloved grey steed, trained for such a struggle, moved
his head and his neck so cleverly that he threw his master back into
the saddle. Strahinya, in his turn, now struck his adversary&rsquo;s
shoulder with great force, but the mighty Turk sat unshaken, although
by this time his horse&rsquo;s legs were sunk in the black earth up to
the knees.</p>
<p>And so the battle went on until the combatants broke each
other&rsquo;s clubs, when they took to their sharp sabres, hoping to
decide the combat very soon. But lo! Banovitch&rsquo;s sabre was not a
common one; two strong smiths had spent a week in shaping it and in
smelting the finest of fine steel for its blade. The Turk made a swift
slash at his foe, but Strahinya caught the gleaming steel on his own
blade, and the sabre was instantly severed above the hilt. This pleased
Banovitch greatly, and, fiercely pressing the Turk, he now tried to
hack off his adversary&rsquo;s arms. But the heroes were well matched;
Vlah-Ali guarded his head most deftly with the remaining stump of his
sabre, and, bit by bit, he broke away his adversary&rsquo;s weapon,
until once more the two were on equal terms. They now dismounted, and
grasping each other firmly, they heaved and wrestled with all their
strength. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>Finally Strahinya, feeling that he was almost spent, called upon his
wife to take the other part of the Turk&rsquo;s sabre and to settle the
contest by striking either his head or that of Vlah-Ali. Thereupon
Vlah-Ali called out: &ldquo;My darling! O thou wife of Strahinya!
Strike me not, but rather strike Banovitch as thou canst never again be
dear to him; he will blame and scorn thee for ever and ever. But thou
shalt be always most dear to me. I will escort thee to Yedrenet, thirty
maids shall there be to wait upon thee: to carry thy robes and wide
sleeves. With sweet-meats will I feed thee and will cover thee with
golden ducats from head to foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Women may easily be misled by fair words: and so the wife of
Strahinya sprang forward and picked up a piece of the sharp blade,
wrapping it carefully in fine silk, for she feared it might wound her
hand. Then she ran swiftly to the fighting heroes, and taking all care
not to hurt Ali, she violently struck the head of Banovitch, and cut
through the golden crest and the white helmet. The blade but slightly
gashed Strahinya&rsquo;s head, but down rushed the blood over his face
fast and thick and all but blinded him.</p>
<p>At this bitter moment, Strahinya thought of his faithful Caraman and
called to him twice. The dog rushed furiously at the faithless woman
and held her fast,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3096src" href=
"#xd19e3096" name="xd19e3096src">3</a> whereupon she was much terrified
and screaming loudly, she threw the blade afar and seized the dog by
its ears. The Turk, alarmed and distracted, turned round to see what
had happened. So encouraged was Strahinya at this new proof of his
dog&rsquo;s intelligence and faithfulness, that new strength came to
him and seizing the opportunity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>he threw his adversary on the
ground and slew him with his teeth &ldquo;as wolves slaughter
lambs.&rdquo; Then he carried away his wife (whom the intelligent
Caraman had left unhurt) to her father&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p class="first">When Youg Bogdan and his sons saw Strahinya covered
with blood, they were greatly astonished that there should be a Turk
valiant enough to wound a hero such as Strahinya. But Strahinya
narrated to them the shameful conduct of his wife, and the story made
Youg Bogdan so incensed that he commanded his sons to pierce their
sister with their swords. But the ever chivalrous Strahinya protested,
exclaiming: &ldquo;O my brothers-in-law, ye nine Yougovitch! Why, O
brothers would ye cover yourselves with shame to-day? On whom would ye
draw your blades? Since ye are, O brothers, so blood-thirsty and so
courageous, where were all your knives and your bright sabres when I
went to the field of Kossovo? Why did ye not accompany me then, and
exhibit your bravery before the fierce Turks? Why did ye not then prove
yourselves to be my friends? I will not let ye kill your sister;
without your help I could have slain her myself. She is but a frail and
easily misguided woman! But I shall not kill her: on the contrary she
will henceforth be dear to me as ever.&rdquo;</p>

"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>O thou one and indivisible God! Mayest
thou be glorified!&rdquo;.... Tsar Lazar sat at supper, and with him
sat the Tsarina Militza, sorrowful and depressed. This unusual aspect
of his beloved consort alarmed the Tsar, and he asked her tenderly:
&ldquo;O Militza, thou my Tsarina! If I put a question to thee, wouldst
thou answer me with the truth? Why art thou so gloomy, so sorrowful and
pale to-night? Is anything thou desirest lacking in our castle?&rdquo;
The Tsarina replied: &ldquo;O Tsar Lazar, thou Serbian golden crown!
Verily whensoever thou speakest to me I answer but the truth. Nothing
is lacking in our palace; but truly a great misfortune has befallen me,
for the Zmay of Yastrebatz is accustomed, ever since last year to come
to my tower each night to embrace me.&rdquo; Tsar Lazar, astounded,
said: &ldquo;Listen to me, O Tsarina Militza! When thou hast retired to
thine apartment in the white tower to-night and thy magic lover hath
come, ask him if there be any besides God whom he fears, and if there
is to be found on this earth a hero whom he deems superior to
himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after supper the Tsar went to his narrow and many-storied
<i>tchardack</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3137src" href="#xd19e3137"
name="xd19e3137src">2</a> and the Tsarina retired to her tower. And it
was seen how the mountain Yastrebatz glowed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>suddenly as if on fire, and how out of the
flames flew the Zmay straight over the level plain of Kroushevo to the
Tsarina&rsquo;s tower.</p>
<p>When he entered the Tsarina&rsquo;s apartment he took off his fairy
garment and looked tenderly upon the fair woman. The Tsarina affected
to welcome her lover, and after a time she said: &ldquo;I pray thee, O
Zmay of Yastrebatz, since thou comest so daringly to my tower, tell me
is there any besides God whom thou dreadest? and lives there in the
whole world any hero whom thou deemest superior to thyself?&rdquo;
Thereupon the Zmay answered in surprise: &ldquo;Keep silent, O Militza!
(or mayest thou remain speechless for ever!) Surely thou askest me this
question because thou hast been instructed by Lazar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Militza swore to him, saying: &ldquo;No, not so! May I perish if
I speak not the truth! I ask thee because I see thou art such an
excellent hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Zmay heard this he trusted to the false oath (less
dangerous it would have been for him if a viper had bitten him!) and
spoke in this wise: &ldquo;O Militza, dearest Tsarina! Since thou
askest me truly, truly shall I answer thee. On the whole of this earth
I dread none but God; neither is there hero whom I fear, save only that
on a plain called Sirmia there is a village known as Koopinovo, and in
that village lives a Zmay-Despot Vook; him I fear, for I have known him
ever since our foolish childhood. We often used to play together on the
summit of the high mountain Yastrebatz, and Vook would always get the
better of me in our contests. It is Vook only whom I dread, for he is
the champion Zmay on this earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Zmay pronounced the last of these words, Danitza&mdash;the
morning star&mdash;appeared on the horizon and the Zmay instantly took
flight to his castle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tsarina hastened to Lazar&rsquo;s tchardack and informed him of
what she had learnt from the Zmay. Hearing the story the Tsar decided
to write in &lsquo;slender characters&rsquo; a message to Zmay-Despot
Vook telling what he had learned beseeching him to come to Kroushevatz
and kill his detested enemy the Zmay of Yastrebatz. For rendering that
service Vook should receive three tovars of ducats and the kingdom of
Sirmia to be his for life.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3156" class="main">Vook as Champion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The message duly reached the hands of Zmay-Despot
Vook, and, having perused it he considered for a while as to what he
should do. He loved the friend of his childhood, but he could not
condone his shameful conduct. Finally he decided to battle with the
Zmay of Yastrebatz, so he saddled his black steed, presented to him by
the veela, and that very night he reached the plain of Kroushevo; there
he alighted; spread his tent in the wheat-fields of Lazar and drank
cool wine.</p>
<p>Meantime the sun rose and as the Tsar slowly paced his balcony, he
suddenly noticed a tent in his fields, and a strange and very wonderful
knight within it. He immediately called the Tsarina and pointed out to
her what he saw. Militza exclaimed that this must be none other than
Zmay-Despot Vook, for he much resembled her magic lover the Zmay of
Yastrebatz.</p>
<p>The Tsar immediately sent a messenger to the stranger bidding him
come at once to the palace, where a noble feast awaited him. But Vook
sent word that he desired to remain in his tent and he requested that
the Tsarina should not close fast the doors of her apartments that
night but should quietly await the coming of the Zmay of Yastrebatz and
leave the issue to her new protector. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>Upon receiving Vook&rsquo;s reply the Tsar ordered a fine repast to
be prepared and taken to his tent, not omitting a large quantity of red
wine.</p>
<p>The day passed uneventfully, and when night came the fair Militza
retired. As usual Mount Yastrebatz burst into its customary light, and
its lord flew from the flames straight to the Tsarina&rsquo;s tower and
stole into her chamber, where he doffed his magic garment. Suddenly he
heard the voice of Zmay-Despot Vook saying: &ldquo;Thou who hath
presumed to embrace the Serbian Tsarina, come forth this instant from
the white tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly alarmed, the Zmay of Yastrebatz cursed the Tsarina thus:
&ldquo;Lo, Militza, may God destroy thee! Thou hast betrayed me to
Lazar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this he donned his magic garment and made haste to depart.
Instead of as usual, directing his flight to his castle on Yastrebatz,
he ascended straight into the clouds. Vook pursued him very closely and
coming up with him at an extreme height, he struck him violently with
his heavy club and broke both his wings. Down fell the Zmay of
Yastrebatz, swift as a stone to the earth, where he lay writhing like a
snake and moaning piteously&mdash;&ldquo;May a similar misfortune
befall every hero who entrusts his mistress with his secrets!&rdquo; He
had not a long time in which to indulge his bitter reflections for Vook
was following and the instant he alighted he struck off the head of the
Zmay. Then he went to Lazar and threw the head upon the ground before
him. The Tsar was so terrified at the mere sight of the ghastly object
that he was seized suddenly by a severe fever. But he gave the promised
gold to Vook as well as an imperial decree empowering him to rule
independently over Sirmia for the remainder of his life. Moreover, he
promised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>that should Vook ever be without gold, he need
but apply to the Tsar, and he should have his needs supplied. The bard
ends: &ldquo;And they long lived happily, always helping each other, as
fellow-countrymen should do; and the glory of the hero became a
tradition; we now remember the anniversary of the slaying of the Zmay
of Yastrebatz as the happiest day in the year!&rdquo; <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This ballad from which the King of
Montenegro&mdash;Nicholas Petrovitch&mdash;drew inspiration for his
drama <i>The Empress of the Balkans</i> is undoubtedly the finest
Serbian national poem ever composed and chanted in Montenegro. To
render it satisfactorily in its poetic form into another language,
compact as it is of intensely national characteristics, metaphors and
other figures of speech, religious conceptions, customs and
superstitions, would be impossible for even the greatest of our
poets.</p>
<p>A French proverb says <i lang="fr">quand on n&rsquo;a pas ce que
l&rsquo;on aime, ou aime ce que l&rsquo;on a</i>, and the hope may here
be expressed that the philosophic English reader will make the best of
the following prose version, such as it is, of a most interesting
national poem.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ivan Tzrnoyevitch<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3198src"
href="#xd19e3198" name="xd19e3198src">1</a> sailed across the Adriatic
to Venice, in order to pay a visit to the doge and to ask his daughter
in marriage for his son Maximus. He remained there three years, during
which he spent three tovars of gold and upon his departure at the end
of this period he arranged to return the following year with his son
and with one thousand, or more, guests for the marriage festivities.
The doge and his two sons, as well as a hundred of the doge&rsquo;s
high dignitaries, accompanied Ivan to his galley and the Montenegrin
prince repeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135"
name="pb135">135</a>]</span>his promise to come again the next year
with his guests and with his son, than whom, he averred, no finer hero
or handsomer youth could be found in any gathering of one thousand
Montenegrins or one thousand Venetians. The doge, exceedingly pleased
to have for his son-in-law such a fine hero, embraced Ivan, saying:
&ldquo;I thank thee, my friend, for such words! How happy I am to have
gained such a dear son-in-law, whose equal should in vain be sought
among thousands! I shall love him more than the sight of my eyes; and
shall prepare precious gifts for him: horses and falcons, helmets with
golden crests and round him cloaks to wrap such as he may be proud to
wear. But if he be not as handsome as thou hast said; woe to
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this Ivan sailed for Zablak. As he neared his castle he felt
very happy and urged on his steed Zdral the sooner to reach home. His
faithful consort perceived him from afar, and at once gave orders to
the servants to make the necessary preparations for the arrival of
their lord. She judged from the gay appearance of her husband that he
must have succeeded in his mission.</p>
<p>When Ivan arrived in the courtyard of his castle, some of his
servants helped him to alight from his steed, others took off his
armour and arms, and his son Maximus brought him a silver settle that
he might be seated and rest. Ivan turned to thank his son, but behold!
A misfortune had befallen him! During his father&rsquo;s absence
Maximus had been stricken with small-pox&mdash;that terrible
scourge!&mdash;and his once handsome face was so pitted and seamed that
it was now horrible to look upon. The bard assures us that it was
hardly possible to find an uglier fellow than Maximus had become.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prince immediately recollected his boast to the doge, that there
could not be found amongst thousands a handsomer youth than his son,
and he felt very sad; his long moustache drooped down on to his
shoulders,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3210src" href="#xd19e3210" name=
"xd19e3210src">2</a> and, with eyes fixed on the ground he sat silent
and gloomy. His consort saw with concern her husband&rsquo;s
despondency and she endeavoured to raise his spirits. Gathering up the
folds of her flowing robe and the ends of her long sleeves, she came
close and, bending, kissed his hand. &ldquo;Pray, my lord,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;why art thou so sad? Hast thou, perhaps, not been
successful in thy mission? Hast thou not betrothed the doge&rsquo;s
daughter to our son? Is she perhaps not fair enough to become thy
daughter-in-law? Dost thou regret the three tovars of gold which thou
hast spent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Ivan roused himself and replied that it was quite another
misfortune which was troubling him. He told how he had successfully
betrothed the doge&rsquo;s daughter, and that she was so beautiful that
even the veele could not be compared with her; that it was not the
thought of the gold he had spent that tormented him&mdash;for his
castle was heaped up with treasure, and the abstraction of three tovars
of ducats had hardly affected the size of the store. No, the real cause
of his misfortune was that he had promised the doge to give him for his
son-in-law a youth who was the handsomest to be found amongst
thousands, and that if he were to present his son Maximus as he now
was, the doge would surely be angry and a war would ensue.</p>
<p>When the princess heard this, she reproached Ivan with having gone
so far away for a bride, when he could have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>found in Montenegro itself a much finer maiden
whose family would be worthy of an alliance with his own. Prince Ivan
was persuaded that he had acted unwisely, and he decided to abandon the
betrothal, and forbade his friends to congratulate him.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3220" class="main">The Message from the Doge</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nine years elapsed, and it seemed that the betrothal
had been forgotten by all, and that the doge&rsquo;s daughter, having
heard nothing from Ivan, had surely wedded another prince. But one day
a message from the doge arrived, in which he reproached the Montenegrin
prince with having allowed nine years to pass without sending a word to
his daughter&mdash;who, &ldquo;from only a bud, had developed into a
beauteous rose.&rdquo; He further requested Ivan to write to his still
patient daughter, and to tell her plainly what he had decided with
regard to the proposed marriage; for if he did not now deem his son
worthy of such a precious maiden, he must at once tell her so, that a
prince deserving of her might be found.</p>
<p>The prince was seized with great grief as he read the doge&rsquo;s
message. What could he say or do? After pondering long he sought his
princely consort and addressed her in this wise: &ldquo;O my sweet-eyed
darling! I pray you counsel me now what to do! Shall I despatch a
message to the maiden and tell her that she is at liberty to seek
another in marriage, or how otherwise shall I write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess was a wise woman, and she advised her husband
prudently:<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3228src" href="#xd19e3228" name=
"xd19e3228src">3</a> &ldquo;O my lord, thou Tzrnoyevitch <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>Ivo!
Has ever any man been counselled by a wife? This has never been and
never shall be. For we women have long hair, but little brains. But as
thou hast asked for my opinion, I will venture to say that it would be
a sin before God, and before the world a shame, to deprive a maiden of
happiness by releasing her from a suitably arranged betrothal. Listen
to me, dear lord! What an insignificant reason alarms thee! If the
small-pox has damaged thy son&rsquo;s visage, thy distant friends
should make allowance for such misfortune resulting from
illness&mdash;for who is exempt? Furthermore, if thou dreadest a
conflict when thou comest to Venice, I would remind thee that thou hast
dungeons full of pure golden ducats; in thy cellars there is old wine
in abundance; thy granaries are overfilled with wheat and other grain;
consequently thou art well able to gather a great number of svats. Thou
hast promised the doge to go thither with one thousand svats, but why
shouldest thou not take two thousand chosen heroes and equerries with
thee? When the Venetians see with how great a force thou journeyest,
they will not dare to attack thee, even if thy son were blind.
Therefore, gather the svats, and hasten to bring the bride. O my lord,
lose no more time in vain musing.&rdquo; At these bold words, the
prince expressed his great satisfaction in a burst of laughter. He
immediately inscribed a missive and despatched it by a speedy courier.
Its contents ran thus: &ldquo;O my friend, thou Doge of Venice! Thou
could&rsquo;st hear, if thou didst but listen, the roaring of my thirty
cannons, which I am about to fire from my fortress! O friend, do not
lose a single moment, but send at once galleys to meet me, my son and
all our svats. Farewell!&rdquo; Ivan then sent to Milosh
Obrenbegovitch, inviting him to be the stari-svat and to attend with as
many chosen heroes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>as he could possibly find within the
provinces of Antivari and Dulzigno. He wrote also to his cousin,
Captain Yovan, inviting him to come to the wedding with as many of his
friends as possible. Couriers were sent to other friends, who received
Ivan&rsquo;s invitation gladly, and before long the plain of Zablak was
studded with their innumerable tents. One morning Ivan noticed Captain
Yovan, the bride&rsquo;s leader, pacing sadly the ramparts of the
castle, and casting frequent glances at the spearmen, equerries and
standards in the encampment below. Prince Ivan would not suffer anybody
to be unhappy in the midst of his festive preparations, and so asked
Captain Yovan the cause of his gloom. Yovan said, that if he might
speak of what was lying upon his heart, he would counsel the prince to
prepare a great feast for those numberless Montenegrins encamped before
his castle, after which couriers should be sent throughout the camp
telling all to return home that their fields should not be ruined by
neglect. Thus the land would not be deprived of defenders against their
persistent foe, the Turk, who might attack the country at any moment
while they were away. Then Yovan went on to relate to the prince how
the previous night he had seen in a dream the sky suddenly covered with
dark clouds; from those clouds a thunderbolt had fallen upon his
princely castle and razed every single stone of it to the ground; a
fire had then broken out and consumed the beautiful capital Zablak.
When the castle fell a tower had struck Maximus but without doing him
serious hurt. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; continued Yovan, &ldquo;if
there be any truth in dreams, Maximus would either perish or be
severely wounded in Venice, and if I should be offended by a Venetian,
all my followers, five hundred men of Podgoritza, would die in my
defence.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=

<p>Prince Ivan laughed heartily when Yovan had ended, and said that his
good friend owed his bad dreams to the fact that his pillows were
either too high or too low. Then saying, &ldquo;dreams are false, but
God is true,&rdquo; he turned away to give orders to fire thirty guns
from the fortress as the signal for departure.</p>
<p>When the cannon roared, especially the two famous guns <i>Krgno</i>
and <i>Zelenko</i>, the whole valley quaked, the black mountains
resounded and the water of Zetina was stirred to its depths. Some
equerries were shaken from their steeds and those standing fell on
their knees on the grass, for it is no light matter when siege-guns
roar!</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3255" class="main">The Wedding Procession sets out</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The svats started on the journey in the best of
spirits; some urged and raced their coursers, others were drinking and
singing gay wedding songs as they marched. In their midst rode Prince
Ivan on his courser Zdral, with two proud falcons on his shoulders; on
his right rode Maximus, and on his left Milosh Obrenbegovitch. Prince
Ivan glanced often at his companions, and involuntarily drew a
comparison between the two. All at once he ordered a halt and spake
aloud, saying: &ldquo;Listen, O my brothers, ye glorious svats! I have
a plan to propose, and hope that you will think it good. We are on the
point of embarking, O brothers, and will soon arrive in Venice. But
look upon my son Maximus, how much spoilt is his appearance by horrible
disease; he is unquestionably the ugliest of us all! Alas! when I was
in Venice nine years ago I praised him as the handsomest youth to be
found amongst one thousand Montenegrins; yea, even amongst one thousand
Venetians. Therefore, O brothers, I am very sad this morning, and have
no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>pleasure in the thought of meeting the doge.
Hear that the Venetians may attack us, so great will be their
disappointment. But behold! O ye my valiant svats! We have here with us
a hero whose equal in manly beauty must be vainly sought amongst us, as
also amongst the proud Venetians. I speak of Vo&iuml;vode Milosh
Obrenbegovitch. Let us, then, take off the plumed helmet from the head
of my son and place it upon Milosh&rsquo;s head, and thus make him the
bridegroom for the time being, until we have peacefully gained
possession of the maiden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The svats were greatly impressed by Ivan&rsquo;s scheme, but they
hesitated to speak, fearing to hurt the feelings of Maximus, who was a
spirited youth and might resent the proposal. But Vo&iuml;vode Milosh
said graciously: &ldquo;O Ivan, our lord! Why dost thou make vain
appeal to the svats? Rather give me thy hand as a sign of firm faith
that the plan does not in any way offend thy noble son. Swear to me by
the true God that thou hast suggested this after an understanding with
thy son, and I will in return pledge my honour that I shall obtain the
bride for Maximus without a fight. You shall consent, however, to cede
to me as my reward for playing a false part all the presents that may
be given to me as the bridegroom, and I shall not be expected to divide
them with anybody, but shall retain them all for myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan burst into laughter, and exclaimed: &ldquo;O Milosh, thou
Serbian Vo&iuml;vode! As to the presents thou namest, I give thee my
faith, firmer and harder than stone itself, that nobody shall seek to
have a share in them with thee! Only secure the bride and honourably
escort her till we reach our city of Zablak, and I promise to give thee
two bootfuls of golden ducats, a golden cup to hold nine litres of
wine, a mare &lsquo;Bedevia,&rsquo; the mother of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>studs like my Zdral, and I shall girdle on thee
a sabre worth thirty purses of golden ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all agreed, and having placed the distinctive hat and
ornaments of the bridegroom on the head of Vo&iuml;vode Milosh they
resumed their journey, and after some tossing upon the waters of the
Adriatic they reached Venice without misadventure.</p>
<p>There came large numbers of people curious to see the Montenegrins
and especially to discover for themselves if Maximus was really the
fine and handsome prince that they had heard he was.</p>
<p>When the Venetian princes heard from their servants that their
future brother-in-law was really as handsome as his father had
described him nine years earlier, they came eagerly with outstretched
arms to embrace and welcome him. They showed him the apartments in
their palace which had been prepared for the princely guests, and all
were lodged in comfort.</p>
<p>The wedding festivities lasted for three days and then came the hour
of departure. At the sound of cannon the svats assembled in the great
courtyard awaiting the commands of Prince Ivan, and his noble son. They
felt uneasy when they saw the gate of the palace closed, and on each
side of it two Moorish and two Venetian soldiers standing with drawn
swords the blades of which, and even their own arms, were covered with
blood. Their uneasiness became alarm when after some time they saw no
sign of their prince and the bride and bridegroom. They were beginning
to murmur loudly when suddenly they heard the sound of horses&rsquo;
hoofs on the marble pavement and they saw Vo&iuml;vode Milosh trying to
curb his destrier with his bit as he spurred him gently in order to
make him bound and prance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3278" class="main">The Wedding Gifts</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Behind Milosh rode his two brothers-in-law bringing
gifts. The elder of them led a black steed without a single blemish,
bearing a silver saddle adorned with heavy gold, upon which sat the
fair bride holding a grey falcon. &ldquo;Accept, O my dear and noble
Maximus,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;this fair maiden, together with
her black steed and her grey falcon as a token of our love, for thou
art in truth the pride of thy brothers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh bowed deeply over his horse&rsquo;s neck as he thanked the
prince for his gracious words and accepted the bride with the gifts
which she brought. The second brother now bestowed upon the bridegroom
a sabre in a golden scabbard, saying: &ldquo;Wear this, O brother, and
be proud of it!&rdquo; Next came the father of the bride. What a
beautiful present he placed in his hands! A helmet in the crest of
which shone a precious stone dazzling like the sun so that one could
not look at it long. But the gift which was given to him by the mother
of the bride was more magnificent than all! This gift was a shirt of
pure gold, which was neither woven nor twined, but had been made
entirely with fingers; in its collar, representing a viper (&lsquo;and
a viper will finally bite him&rsquo;) there was fixed a brilliant
diamond shedding forth such a blaze of light that he would never need a
candle when he went to visit his bride in her bed-chamber. All the
svats were astonished at the magnificence of the present.</p>
<p>Now came the aged brother of the doge, Yesdimir, with his beard
reaching to his waist, walking slowly and supporting himself with a
golden staff. Bitter tears streamed from his eyes. He wept, it is true,
with good reason. Seven wives he had had in turn during his long
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>life, but no sons or daughters had been born to
him. Therefore he bestowed all his affections upon his niece, whom he
looked upon as a daughter, and who took in his heart the place of the
children he had once hoped to be blessed with, and now that the beloved
maiden was to depart to a far-away land he was greatly grieved. He had
some &lsquo;wonder&rsquo; folded under his arm, and as he approached
the svats, he called the bridegroom by name. The latter appeared at
once and the venerable lord laid upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulders a
magnificent cloak which reached from his shoulders down to the grass.
Indeed when Milosh remounted his horse, the cloak concealed not only
himself, but also his steed down to its very hoofs. How precious it
was! and oh! that it might never be the cause of anything but happiness
to the hero! It was said that thirty purses of gold had been spent on
its lining alone, and what a sum of money the cloth itself must have
cost! Prince Maximus watched and saw with envious eyes how Vo&iuml;vode
Milosh received the presents which were intended for him, the real
bridegroom. When the large gateways of the courtyard were opened, the
svats, passing out in procession, received from the doge&rsquo;s
servants each a piece of precious silk and a box containing various
presents, and then they sailed away in galleys.</p>
<p>Soon they arrived on the field of Zablak, where they had met on
starting out for their journey, and where they were now to separate.
Prince Maximus had ridden a little ahead with his ten brothers-in-arms
in order to hasten and communicate the joyful news to his mother and
Vo&iuml;vode Milosh, being aware that Prince Maximus was out of sight,
spurred forward his courser and coming up with the bride and the dever,
he boldly took the hand of the noble maiden. The bride, thinking in her
innocence that he was Prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>Maximus, removed her veil and
stretched out her hands to the pretended bridegroom.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3293" class="main">The Princess learns of the
Deception</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Those who were near feigned not to have noticed the
incident, but Prince Ivan himself happened to see what had occurred and
it troubled him, and he rode up and addressed the bride thus:
&ldquo;Touch him not with thy hands, O my dear daughter-in-law! or may
they be struck with a palsy! Veil thine eyes! or may thy sight for ever
fail thee! How canst thou act so in the presence of all the svats? Dost
thou see that hero riding his black steed, and holding his lance? Dost
thou see his shining shield and his face disfigured by small-pox? That
is my son Maximus, whom I praised to thy father&mdash;when I asked your
hand for him&mdash;saying that there was no handsomer youth than he to
be found amongst thousands. But I was afraid to present my son with his
ugly face to you and to your father, and so we had recourse to a
stratagem and made Vo&iuml;vode your groom temporarily in order to
succeed in bringing thee away in peace. For acting so Milosh is
entitled to all the presents which were assigned to the
bridegroom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the noble maiden her father-in-law&rsquo;s words came as a
thunderbolt. She halted her horse and refused to go any farther,
saying: &ldquo;O my dear father-in-law, thou Prince Ivan! Thou hast
caused thine own son&rsquo;s misfortune by having made Milosh the
alleged bridegroom. Why hast thou done so? May the true God give thee
thy deserts for that! What matters it if his face is pitted? All are
subject to disease, and might have to suffer even worse consequences.
If his face is damaged, his eyes are certainly bright and his heart is
as sound as ever. If thou hadst considered thy son to be still too
young to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>my husband, thou shouldest have told me so, and
I would have waited in my father&rsquo;s palace for another nine
years&mdash;but even then I would certainly never have caused you to
blush with shame before your own nobles in Zablak. Now thou hadst
better give up the presents to their rightful owner, thy son Maximus,
else I shall not go a step further, even if thou shouldest threaten to
put out my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this firm speech, Prince Ivan was greatly disturbed, and he
called friends and Vo&iuml;vodes to counsel him as to what he should
do. But none of them dared say one word, for they well remembered the
arrangement made before sailing across the sea.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3304" class="main">Milosh&rsquo;s Offer</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vo&iuml;vode Milosh saw that no one would speak, and
he spurred his steed and addressed Prince Ivan in this wise: &ldquo;O
Ivan, thou our lord! Where is thy firm faith? If it fails now, may you
yourself live to be betrayed! Hast thou not given me thy word that the
wedding gifts should be mine intact? But now you frame a plan to break
thy faith! Since thou art so little to be depended on, I
agree&mdash;for the sake of peace among our brothers and svats&mdash;to
give up the first two presents: I return to your son the fair bride and
her steed with all its gold and silver trappings. In justice, and
according to impartial judgment, I should be fully entitled even to
marry the fair maiden&mdash;for she was presented to me by all, her
parents and her brothers&mdash;but I shall say no more about that, and
simply cede to you these two presents, together with the grey falcon.
Here! I return to your son even the golden scabbard and the bright
sabre, but I shall never consent to yield the helmet, the cloak, and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>golden shirt; for I am determined to carry them
to my own land, and show them to my friends and brothers, who, I am
certain, will be proud of them. I swear by my faith in the true God
that I shall not give up these three presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the svats, moved by Milosh&rsquo;s fairness, agreed to the
offer, and thanked him for his noble sacrifice for the sake of peace,
but they were strongly opposed by the bride, who could not reconcile
herself to the loss of the precious gifts, and especially the golden
shirt. So she called aloud for Prince Maximus. This alarmed Prince Ivan
very much, and he tried to quieten the maiden in these words: &ldquo;O
my sweet daughter-in-law, thou Venetian maiden! Do not call my son, for
we have done him great injustice. Prince Maximus has a high sense of
honour and is a brave man. I dread a fight above everything, and our
festivities may so easily turn into mourning. I possess in Zablak a
dungeon full of golden treasure, which I shall present to thee, and
thou canst do with it whatever pleases thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the maiden was not easy to persuade, and she once more called
Prince Maximus, who came with all speed to the scene. &ldquo;O Maximus,
thou only son of thy mother!&rdquo; began his bride, &ldquo;may she
lose thee! May the warriors make a handbier of thy lance and with thy
shield may they cover thy tomb! May thy visage blush with shame on the
day of judgment, as it does to-day at the contest with Vo&iuml;vode
Milosh! Why didst thou agree to yield to another the presents which
rightly belong to the bridegroom? I care nothing for all the other
presents, let Milosh take them away, and may a torrent take him away
with them! but I cannot suffer the loss of the golden shirt, which I
made for thee myself, and which took me three years to make, with three
maidens assisting me. I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>nearly lost my sight before I

thee. Thou hadst better recover the shirt from Vo&iuml;vode Milosh at
once, for I swear by the name of the true God that otherwise I will not
take a step forward; but I shall rein back my steed, and, when I reach
the sea-coast, I shall pluck a leaf of aloe and shall scratch my face
with its thorns till blood flows; then I shall write and send a message
by my falcon to my aged father, beseeching him to call to arms all his
force, to come and conquer and pillage thy Zablak and repay thee thus
with mourning for thy shameful conduct!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The moment Prince Maximus heard this, he reined back
his black courser, spurred it so vehemently that the skin of his
courser&rsquo;s stifle-joint burst and blood besprinkled its hoofs. The
frantic animal sprang the height of three lances in the air and the
length of four lances forward, so that he sped like lightning. Milosh
burst into laughter, saying: &ldquo;God be praised! What was suddenly
the matter with that boy!&rdquo; But his mirth was short-lived, for
Prince Maximus now turned his horse straight toward Milosh furiously
throwing his lance at his head.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3321src"
href="#xd19e3321" name="xd19e3321src">4</a> He struck Milosh so
vigorously that both his eyes burst and he fell from his steed. Maximus
rushed in and cleft his head asunder; then he took his bride from her
leader and sped into the castle.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3324src"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=

<p class="first">Prince Maximus, it is said, was so disgusted with what
had occurred that he wrote to the doge, inviting him to invade Zablak
with a large force and to conquer Montenegro; as for him, he would go
to Istamboul and embrace Islamism. This he did.</p>
<p>Now a brother of Milosh, namely, Yovan Obrenbegovitch, suspecting
that Maximus&rsquo;s intention was to obtain from the Sultan a great
force with which to conquer Montenegro, decided to go to the Sultan for
the same purpose. But it was his intention, should he also succeed in
obtaining an army from the Sultan, to use it, not against his
fatherland, Montenegro, but against Prince Maximus. On their way to
Istamboul the two men met and they appeared together before the Sultan,
who, knowing well who they were and deeming that they could be usefully
employed in his service against the Christians, like many other
malcontents from Christian courts, received them most kindly. They
adopted the Mohammedan religion and were given Turkish names:
<span class="corr" id="xd19e3338" title=
"Source: Vo&iuml;vod">Vo&iuml;vode</span> Yovan was called Mehmed-Bey
Obrenbegovitch, and Prince Maximus, Scander-beg Ivanbegovitch. Having
served as faithful Turks for nine years, the Sultan, pleased with their
conduct, granted them both vizirates: to Mehmed-bey Obrenbegovitch he
gave as fief the plain of Ducadyin, and Scander-beg (Prince
Ivan&rsquo;s son) he granted Scutari on the River Boyana. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">King Michael of Ledyen had a beautiful daughter,
Roksanda, and when Tsar Doushan asked her hand in marriage the king
immediately consented. The betrothal was arranged by means of couriers,
and Doushan had not seen the princess; he therefore summoned Theodor,
his counsellor of State: &ldquo;Listen to me, my trusty Theodor!&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;thou shalt go to the white city Ledyen to King Michael,
and thou shalt ask him to fix the date for the wedding festivities.
Thou shalt also settle with him other customary preliminaries and
satisfy thyself that the peerless Roksanda is a fitting tsarina for our
Serbian lands.&rdquo; Theodor promised to fulfil his mission faithfully
and, having made the necessary preparations, he set out for the
Venetian province. When he arrived at the white city Ledyen the king
welcomed him courteously and lavished hospitality upon him for a full
week.</p>
<p>Then Theodor spoke to the king in this wise: &ldquo;O my
master&rsquo;s friend, thou gallant King Michael! My tsar has not sent
me here only that I should drink thy wine; he desires that I should
arrange his marriage; tell me, when shall my master come? what time of
the year will suit you best to receive him? how many svats shall he
bring with him when he comes to take from thee the beautiful maiden
Roksanda? My master also instructed me that I should desire of thee to
be permitted the happiness of seeing the fair princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the king answered: &ldquo;O my friend, Theodor! take my
greetings to the tsar and tell him that he is at liberty to bring with
him as many svats as he may please; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>also tell him that he
may come for the maiden whenever he may choose; but request him in my
name that under no circumstances shall he bring with him his nephews
the two Vo&iuml;novitchs, Voukashin and Petrashin, for indeed I have
heard that they are very quarrelsome when in their cups, and I fear
that they may disturb the harmony of our festivities. As to the
princess, she shall come to thee at due time and receive at thy hands
the ring of thy master, as is the well-established custom.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">At nightfall Theodor was conducted into an unlighted
room and while he wondered when the candles would be brought, lo! the
princess stood before him, shrouded in the thick gloom. Theodor was
grieved at the trick played upon him, but he did not despair. He had
with him the magnificent ring of his august master; it was so richly
studded with precious stones that as he produced it the whole room was
lighted up and the rays shone upon the maiden, who seemed to the
ambassador more beautiful than the white veela herself. Theodor
presented the betrothal ring and gave the princess also one thousand
ducats; her brothers then conducted her back to her apartments.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The rays shone upon the maiden</p>
</div>
<p>Next morning Theodor took leave of the king and set out upon his
homeward journey; when he arrived at Prisrend the tsar asked eagerly:
&ldquo;O my trusty Theodor! Didst thou see the maiden Roksanda and
didst thou give her my ring? What greetings dost thou bring me from
King Michael?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Theodor answered: &ldquo;Yea, my Lord, I saw thy bride and
presented her with thy ring; but words fail me to describe the
enchanting beauty of the Princess Roksanda! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>Vain
would it be to search for her equal throughout Serbia! And fair and
well spoke King Michael: Thou canst go for the maiden whensoever thou
choosest, and thou mayest take as many svats as thou pleasest. But the
king prays this one thing of thee: that thou shouldest under no
circumstances take with thee, the Voinovitchs, thy two nephews, for
they are lovers of the wine-cup and are quick to take offence; they may
enter into drunken quarrels, and it may be difficult to settle their
disputes in a peaceable manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard this the tsar struck his knee with his right hand, and
exclaimed: &ldquo;Alas! May God help me! Has the ill fame of my nephews
spread as far as that! By my unshakable faith, I shall, immediately
after the wedding festivities, have them both hung on the gates of
their castle Voutchitrn that they may not any longer bring shame to my
name throughout the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3376" class="main">The Procession Starts</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Soon afterward the tsar proceeded to call his svats
together and when they had all assembled they presented a brilliant
spectacle. The wedding procession rode on its way through the field of
Kossovo and as it passed by the walls of the castle Voutchitrn, the two
youthful Voinovitchs looked upon the cavalcade and spoke sadly to each
other thus: &ldquo;Our uncle must be angry with us, otherwise he would
surely have invited us also to join his wedding party? Some churl must
have uttered ill words against us. May a hundred evils befall him who
has done so! Our tsar is going to the Venetian land and has not a
single hero in his train, neither has he any close relative who might
be depended upon in case of dire misfortune. The Venetians are known
from ancient times <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>to be very cunning and sly and they may
kill our glorious tsar! And yet to accompany him uninvited is more than
we dare do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon their aged mother spoke thus: &ldquo;O my children, ye two
Vo&iuml;novitchs! Ye have a brother in the mountains,
Milosh-the-shepherd; though the youngest, he is the greatest hero of ye
all and will find some way to uphold the honour of our name. The tsar
has never heard about him. I counsel you to send him a message and bid
him come to the castle Voutchitrn, mention not the true reason but tell
him that his mother, being aged, may die at any moment and that she
wishes to give him her blessings. Tell him to make haste if he would
find his mother alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice seemed good to the two brothers. They wrote a missive
and dispatched it with haste to the mountain Shar where
Milosh-the-shepherd tarried with his flocks.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e3387width" id="p154"><img src="images/p154.jpg"

width="720" height="494">
<p class="figureHead">The mountain Shar where Milosh-the-shepherd
tarried with his flocks</p>
</div>
<p>As Milosh read the message his countenance changed and he shed
bitter tears. His grief was observed by thirty shepherds who were
around him: &ldquo;O Milosh, our valiant chieftain!&rdquo; they
exclaimed, &ldquo;Many messages have reached thee, but never yet have
we seen thee shed tears when thou didst read them. Whence came this
letter and what evil tidings does it bring? Tell us quickly, we beseech
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh sprang to his feet and addressed his shepherds in this wise:
&ldquo;Hearken, O shepherds, my dearest brethren! This message comes
from the castle: my mother is on her death-bed and she summons me that
she may give me her blessing, that damnation should not fall upon my
soul. I must hasten to her side and while I am absent from the mountain
I charge ye to watch well the sheep.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Milosh came near to his white castle, his brothers saw him from
a tower and sallied out to meet him; their aged mother also followed.
Milosh was astonished to see her and said reproachfully: &ldquo;Why, O
brothers dear, do ye make misfortune when there is no reason, and when
all is well with ye! May the Almighty forgive your deception!&rdquo;
And his brothers answered: &ldquo;Come within, dear brother, there
<i>is</i> nevertheless great misfortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young men embraced each other and Milosh kissed his
mother&rsquo;s hand. Then his brothers related the story of their
uncle&rsquo;s betrothal and how he was proceeding to the Venetian land
without having invited his two nephews to ride in the wedding
procession, and they besought him in this wise: &ldquo;O, our dear
brother Milosh! Go thou with the tsar, yea, although thou art not
invited. Misfortune may befall, and haply thou shalt succour your
uncle. Thou canst go and come back again without making thyself known
to anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh was no less eager than his brothers, and he answered gladly:
&ldquo;I will go, O my brothers! Indeed how could I do otherwise? If I
were not willing to help our dear uncle, whom else should I be willing
to aid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon his brothers began to make all the necessary preparations.
Peter went to the stables to saddle his steed Koulash, while Vankashin
remained to see that Milosh was fittingly attired. He first put on him
a fine shirt which was embroidered with gold from the neck to the
waist; downward from the waist it was woven of white silk. Over the
shirt he placed three thin, elegant ribbons; then a waistcoat adorned
with thirty golden buttons; then a golden cuirasse weighing some
fifteen pounds. And in all details he attired him with garments worthy
of a prince. Finally he hung upon his broad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>shoulders a coarse Bulgar shepherd&rsquo;s
cloak, which entirely enveloped him, and placed on his head a Bulgarian
fur-cap with high point, thus making him look so like a black Bulgar
that his own mother would not have recognized him. The brothers now
fetched a warrior&rsquo;s lance and mace and the trusty sword of their
old father Vo&iuml;n. Then Peter brought forward Koulash, upon whom he
had fastened a bear&rsquo;s skin in order that the tsar might not
recognize the well-known steed.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3410" class="main">Milosh Joins the Procession</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Milosh was now ready to set out, and as he took leave
of his brothers they counselled him thus: &ldquo;When thou comest up
with the wedding-guests they will ask thee who thou art and whence thou
comest. Thou shalt answer that thou art coming from the Karavallahian
land, where thou hast been serving a Turkish lord, Radoul-bey, who
would not pay thee thy wages, wherefore thou art looking for a more
generous master. Say, moreover, that having received chance tidings of
the tsar&rsquo;s wedding, thou has ridden to join thyself to the
servants of the party, not for any wages, for thou wilt gladly serve
for a piece of bread and a glass of red wine. Thou must, meantime, hold
firmly the reins of thy steed, for Koulash is accustomed to go in the
line with the tsar&rsquo;s own chargers, and he may betray
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the brothers had made an end of their counsel Milosh took leave
of them and of his mother and turned his steed in the <span class=
"corr" id="xd19e3416" title="Source: directon">direction</span> of the
wedding party, and he came up with them in the mountain Zagory&eacute;.
Upon seeing the stranger the svats hailed him: &ldquo;Whence are thou
coming, little young Bulgar?&rdquo; And Milosh answered from afar as
his brothers had counselled. Then the svats welcomed him readily,
saying: &ldquo;Mayest thou be happy with us, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>little young Bulgar! We are always glad to have
one more in our company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princely company, all aglow with the brilliant colours of the
resplendent uniforms, their lances and cuirasses gleaming in the sun,
rode on until they came to a valley. Now Milosh had a bad habit,
acquired in the mountain Shar while watching his sheep, to slumber
toward mid-day, and as his Koulash stepped proudly on he fell into a
deep sleep and his hand suddenly relaxed on the rein. No sooner did
Koulash feel the curb loosen than he arched his neck and flew like an
arrow from a bow through the ranks of the cavalcade, overturning horses
and riders, till he reached the horses of the tsar, when he ranged
himself in line with them and fell into the same slow, measured
pace.</p>
<p>By this time the whole procession had fallen into disorder, and a
crowd of Lale<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3425src" href="#xd19e3425"
name="xd19e3425src">1</a> would have fallen upon the innocent cause of
the commotion, had not Doushan intervened to protect him, saying,
&ldquo;Do not strike this youthful Bulgarian, he is a shepherd, and
shepherds have a habit of dozing toward noon while watching their
sheep; do not be violent, but awaken him gently.&rdquo; Thereupon the
svats awakened Milosh, shouting: &ldquo;Rise, O foolish young
Bulgarian! May the Almighty spare thy old mother who could not give
thee a better understanding but thou must needs venture to join the
company of the tsar!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Milosh awoke with a start, and saw the tsar looking
upon him with his deep black eyes, and lo! his Koulash was in the royal
line! Not a moment did he pause, but, gathering the reins firmly in his
hand, he spurred his steed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>sharply. Koulash for one brief
instant quivered from head to heel, then with a frantic bound he sprang
into the air the height of three lances; for the length of four lances
sideways did he spring, and as for the number of lengths covered by his
leap onward, no one could number them! Fire issued from his mouth and
tongues of blue flame came out from his nostrils! Twelve thousand svats
beheld with awe and admiration the wonderful leap of the Bulgar&rsquo;s
steed, and exclaimed as one man: &ldquo;Father of Mercies, what a
mighty wonder!&rdquo; Then some said to others: &ldquo;O that so good a
horse should be possessed by such a fellow! We have never before seen
such a marvel.&rdquo; Others said: &ldquo;There was, indeed, one
charger like this in the stables of our tsar&rsquo;s son-in-law and now
is possessed by his nephews the brothers Vo&iuml;novitchs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the heroes who admired the steed were Voutch&eacute; of
Dyakovitza, Yanko of Nestopoly&eacute; and a youth from
Priepoly&eacute;; these spake one to another thus: &ldquo;What a
beautiful steed that Bulgar has! There is not its equal to be found in
this wedding cavalcade, not even our own tsar has one like it. Let us
fall behind and seek an opportunity to deprive him of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they reached Klissoura the three horsemen were far behind the
other svats, and Milosh was also riding alone in that place. Then the
heroes came near to him and addressed him in seeming courtesy:
&ldquo;Listen to us, thou youthful Bulgar! Wilt thou exchange thy horse
for a better one? We shall give thee also one hundred ducats as a
bargain-gift, and moreover we shall give thee a plough and a pair of
oxen that thou mayest plough thy fields and feed thyself in peace for
the rest of thy days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Milosh answered: &ldquo;Leave me alone, O ye three mighty
horsemen! I do not wish for a better horse than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>the
one I have already; for did ye not see that I cannot keep even this one
quiet? As to your bargain-gift, what should I do with so many ducats? I
do not know how to weigh them, neither am I able to count as high as
one hundred. What should I do with your plough and your oxen? My father
has never used a plough on his fields and yet his children have never
known hunger!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3444" class="main">The Fight for Koulash</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this answer the three horsemen said angrily:
&ldquo;Thou hadst better consider our proposal, O haughty Bulgar, lest
we take thy horse by force!&rdquo; To this menace Milosh answered:
&ldquo;Truly, by force men take lands and cities, and much more easily
can three men by force take from me my steed! Therefore I prefer to
exchange it, for I am unable to travel on foot.&rdquo; Saying this,
Milosh made a pretence to give up his Koulash peaceably, and inserted
his right hand under his coarse cloak. They thought he intended to take
off his spurs, but they were greatly mistaken, for in a flash out came
his six-angled club, and before they had gathered their wits Milosh
gave Voutch&eacute; a gentle tap that tumbled him over and over three
times in succession. Milosh then addressed him ironically: &ldquo;May
thy vineyards in thy peaceful estate of Dyakovitza be as fertile as
thou art brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing what had befallen his companion, Yanko was in full flight,
but it took scarce a moment for Koulash to reach the flying steed, and
Milosh let fall upon the shoulders of his rider such a blow that he,
too, was hurled to the ground, where he turned over four times ere
finding anchorage. &ldquo;Hold on! O Yanko!&rdquo; scoffed Milosh,
&ldquo;May the apple-trees in thy peaceful estate bear as abundant
fruit as thou art brave to-day!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>There now only remained the young man from Priepoly&eacute; who by
now had fled to some distance. But his horse&rsquo;s speed could not
avail against the swiftness of Koulash, and Milosh soon reached him and
with his warrior club gave him a tap that tumbled him over and over no
less than seven times. Whether he could hear or not Milosh called
aloud: &ldquo;Hold fast, O young man from Priepoly&eacute;! And when
thou goest back to thy Priepoly&eacute;, I give thee leave to boast
before the fair maidens there of how thou hast to-day taken away by
force a Bulgar&rsquo;s steed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This done, Milosh turned his charger and soon reached the wedding
cavalcade. In due course the procession arrived at the white city of
Ledyen, and the Serbians put up their white tents beneath its walls.
The equerries gave the horses barley, but none did they give to
Koulash. When Milosh saw this he took in his left hand a nose-bag and
went from horse to horse, taking with his right hand from each a
handful until he had filled the bag of his trusty Koulash. Next he went
to the principal wine-keeper and prayed that he would give him a glass
of wine. But the keeper of the wine refused, saying: &ldquo;Go away,
thou black Bulgar! If thou hadst brought thy rough Bulgarian wooden
cup, I might perhaps have poured in it a draught; but these golden cups
are not for thee!&rdquo; Milosh turned on the churlish wine-keeper a
dark look and followed it with a tender blow on his cheek that sent
three sound teeth into his throat. Then the man, thoroughly cowed,
besought Milosh thus: &ldquo;Stay thy hand, O mighty Bulgar! There is
wine in abundance for thee, even if our tsar should thereby go
short.&rdquo; But Milosh paid no attention to the fellow, and proceeded
to help himself. Then, as his spirits mounted with the generous wine,
day dawned and the sun began to shine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

early morning a page of King Michael called loudly from a tower of the
royal castle: &ldquo;Listen, O Serbian Tsar Doushan! Behold, in the
valley beneath the walls of the city is the champion of our king! Thou
must fight a duel with him, either thyself or by a substitute. If thou
dost not overcome him thou shalt not go from this place safely, neither
shalt thou take back with thee so much as one of thy wedding-guests!
Still less shalt thou take with thee the princess Roksanda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doushan heard the haughty message and sent a strong-voiced crier
among the wedding-guests. Here and there he stood shouting loudly the
tsar&rsquo;s message: &ldquo;Has any mother given birth to a fearless
hero who will take up the challenge in our tsar&rsquo;s stead? To him
who is brave enough to fight the champion the tsar will grant
nobility.&rdquo; But alas! when the crier had gone through the camp no
hero had come forward to claim the honour of doing battle for the
tsar.</p>
<p>When Doushan heard this, he struck his knee with his right hand,
exclaiming: &ldquo;Woe is me! O mighty Creator! If I had now my darling
nephews, the two Vo&iuml;novitchs, I should not lack a champion.&rdquo;
The tsar had hardly ended his lamentation when Milosh, leading his
steed, appeared before the tsar&rsquo;s tent. &ldquo;O my Lord, thou
mighty tsar!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have I thy leave to fight this
duel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tsar answered: &ldquo;Thou art welcome, O youthful Bulgar! But,
alas, there is slender likelihood that thou canst overpower the haughty
hector of the king. If, however, thou dost succeed, verily I will
ennoble thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh leaped to his saddle, and as he turned his fiery <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>Koulash from the tsar&rsquo;s tent, he
carelessly threw his lance on his shoulder with its point turned
backward. Seeing this, Doushan called to him: &ldquo;Do not carry, O my
son, thy lance so! Turn the point forward, lest the proud Venetians
laugh at thee!&rdquo; But Milosh answered: &ldquo;Attend, O my tsar,
unto thine own dignity, and be not anxious concerning mine! If need
arise I shall easily turn my lance correctly; if not, I may just as
well bring it back in this wrong wise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Milosh rode on through the field of Ledyen, the ladies and
maidens of Ledyen looked upon him, and, laughing, they exclaimed:
&ldquo;Saints in heaven! a marvel! What a substitute for a Serbian
emperor! The young man has even no decent clothes upon him! Be merry,
thou hector of the king, for hardly shalt thou need to unsheath thy
sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime Milosh reached the tent in which sat the champion of the
Venetian king. Before the entrance he had stuck his lance deep into the
ground, and to this he had tethered his grey steed. Milosh addressed
the hector thus: &ldquo;Rise up! thou little white Venetian gentleman,
we will fight together for the honour of our masters!&rdquo; But the
hector answered angrily: &ldquo;Away with thee, thou ugly black Bulgar!
My sword is not for such as thee! I would not soil my steel on such a
ragged fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark made Milosh very angry, and he exclaimed: &ldquo;Rise
up, haughty Venetian! Thou hast indeed richer attire; I shall take it
from thee, and then who will have the finer feathers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the hector sprang to his feet and mounted his grey charger,
which he caused to prance and curvet across the field. Milosh stood
quietly looking on until suddenly the Venetian fiercely hurled his
lance straight to the breast of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>Milosh. The wary Serbian
received it on his golden-headed club and jerked the weapon over his
head, breaking it into three pieces as he did so. This sleight-of-hand
alarmed the hector and he exclaimed: &ldquo;Wait a minute, thou ugly
black Bulgar! My lance was faulty, wait till I get a better one!&rdquo;
With this he put spurs to his steed, but Milosh shouted after him:
&ldquo;Stop, thou white Venetian! Thou shalt not escape me!&rdquo; And
with this he <span class="corr" id="xd19e3482" title=
"Source: spured">spurred</span> his Koulash after the cowardly hector
and pursued close to the gates of Ledyen. Alas for the fugitive, the
gates were closed! For a moment the hector paused irresolute and this
moment was his last. Milosh let loose his unerring lance; it whistled
though the morning air and the hector was transfixed to the gate. Then
Milosh alighted from his steed, struck off the Venetian&rsquo;s head
and threw it in Koulash&rsquo;s nose-bag. Next he caught the grey steed
and rode with him to the tsar. &ldquo;Here, O mighty tsar,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;is the head of the king&rsquo;s hector!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doushan was overjoyed at his prowess and gave him much gold.
&ldquo;Go, my son,&rdquo; said he, kindly, &ldquo;drink some good wine,
and presently I shall make thee noble!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Milosh had hardly seated himself at his wine when a
page again called loudly from the royal castle: &ldquo;Behold, O
Serbian tsar! In the meadow below thou mayest see three fiery horses
saddled, on the back of each there is fastened a flaming sword with
point upward. If thou wouldst go in peace from here taking with thee
the king&rsquo;s daughter, thou must thyself or by deputy leap over
these flaming swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the tsar sent a crier throughout his camp. &ldquo;O
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>Serbians,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;has not any
mother given birth to a hero who will venture to leap over the three
horses <span class="corr" id="xd19e3496" title=
"Source: and and">and</span> the flaming swords fixed on their
backs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he traversed the entire camp, taking care that his words
should come to the ear of every svat, but again no hero came forward to
offer himself. Then as the tsar was anxiously meditating on the problem
he looked up and, lo! Milosh again stood before him. &ldquo;O glorious
tsar!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Have I thy permission to essay this
feat?&rdquo; And the tsar readily answered: &ldquo;Thou mayest surely
go, my dear son! But first take off this clumsy Bulgarian cloak! (may
God punish the stupid tailor who made it so!)&rdquo; But Milosh said:
&ldquo;Sit in peace, O mighty tsar, and drink thy cool wine! Do not be
anxious concerning my coarse cloak. If there be a heart in the hero his
cloak will not be in his way: if a sheep finds her wool too heavy for
her there is no sheep in her nor any wool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he rode down to the meadow of Ledyen where stood the three
steeds tethered side by side fiercely pawing the ground. The young man
dismounted from his Koulash and stationed him several paces from the
third steed, by his side, then patting Koulash gently on his proud
neck, he said: &ldquo;Thou shalt stay here quietly until I come again
to the saddle!&rdquo; He passed over to the first steed and went on a
little distance, then turned, and dancing first on one foot then on the
other, he ran like a swift deer and, leaping high, jumped over the
three steeds, over the flaming swords, and alighted safely on the
saddle of his own Koulash. This done he gathered the reins of the three
chargers and rode with them in triumph to the Serbian tsar.

<p class="first">Very soon the page of the Venetian king came again to
the tower of the royal castle and proclaimed: &ldquo;Hearken, thou tsar
of the Serbs! Under the topmost tower of this castle is a slender lance
whereon a golden apple is stuck; twelve paces distant is set a ring:
thou must shoot an arrow through the ring and transfix the
apple&mdash;thou or thy deputy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Milosh would not wait for the crier to do his errand, but
straightway went to the tsar and obtained his permission to essay the
task. Then, taking his golden bow and arrow, he went to the place
indicated, fixed his arrow on the bow string, and the shaft sped
straight through the ring to the heart of the apple which he caught in
his hand as it fell. Again the tsar bestowed upon him golden ducats
beyond number.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3513" class="main">The Fourth Test</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No sooner was this wonderful exploit completed than
the royal page again proclaimed from the castle turret: &ldquo;Behold,
O tsar of the Serbs! The two royal princes have brought out in front of
the king&rsquo;s palace three beautiful maidens, all exactly alike and
attired in similar robes. The king bids thee guess which of the three
is the princess Roksanda. Woe to thee if thou touchest other maiden but
Roksanda! Thou shalt not have the princess for thy bride; neither shalt
thou go out with thy head upon thy shoulders; still less shall thy
guests leave this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Doushan heard the message he summoned immediately his
councillor Theodor and commanded: &ldquo;Go, Theodor, and tell which is
Roksanda!&rdquo; But Theodor declared that he had seen her but for so
brief a time that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span>it would be impossible that he should be
able to choose between three maidens all exactly like the one he had
seen by the light from his master&rsquo;s ring.</p>
<p>Hearing this the tsar, in despair, struck his knee with his hand,
exclaiming: &ldquo;Alas! alas! After performing many wonderful
exploits, must we return without the bride and be the shame of our
people?&rdquo; Just then Milosh, who had become aware of the
tsar&rsquo;s difficulty, entered into the imperial presence and spake
thus: &ldquo;Have I thy leave, O tsar, to try to guess which of the
maidens is the princess Roksanda?&rdquo; And the tsar answered
joyfully: &ldquo;Indeed thou hast, O darling son of mine! But slender
is the hope that thou shalt guess rightly, since thou hast never seen
the princess before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Milosh answered: &ldquo;Be not fearful, my glorious Lord!
When I was a shepherd in the mountain Shar watching twelve thousand
sheep, there have been born in a night three hundred lambs and I have
been able to recognize and tell which sheep was dam to each lamb. How
much easier will it be to choose Roksanda by her resemblance to her
brothers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go then, my darling son! May God help thee to guess
rightly! If thou art successful I shall grant thee the whole land of
Skender that thou be its lord for thy lifetime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milosh went forth through the wide field until he came to the place
where the three maidens stood waiting. With a swift and sudden motion
he swept the coarse fur-cap from his head and threw from off his
shoulder his heavy cloak, revealing the scarlet velvet and the golden
cuirasse which had been hidden underneath. Truly he shone in the
verdant field like the setting sun behind a forest! Milosh now spread
his cloak on the grass and cast upon it rings, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>pearls, and precious stones. Then he unsheathed
his finely-tempered sword and addressed the three fair maidens thus:
&ldquo;Let her who is the princess Roksanda gather her train and
sleeves together and collect these rings, pearls, and precious stones!
If any but Roksanda should dare to touch these beautiful things, I
swear by my firm faith that I shall instantly cut off her two hands,
yea, even as far as her elbows!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Two of them looked meaningly at their

<p>The three beautiful maidens were terrified, and two of them looked
meaningly at their companion who stood in the middle. This was the
princess, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Roksanda gathered her
silky train and sleeves and began to collect the rings, pearls, and
precious stones. The two other maidens were about to flee, but Milosh
took them gently by their hands and escorted all three to the presence
of the tsar, to whom he presented princess Roksanda together with one
of her companions who might be her lady-in-waiting; the third maiden,
however, he retained for himself. The tsar kissed Milosh between his
fiery eyes, still not knowing who he was or whence he came.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3540" class="main">The Departure of the Serbians</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The masters of the ceremonies now called aloud:
&ldquo;Get ready, all ye svats! It is high time we should hurry
homeward!&rdquo; And the svats made ready for the journey, and soon
they set out, taking with them the beautiful princess Roksanda.</p>
<p>As they departed from the gates of the city, Milosh approached the
tsar and said: &ldquo;O my lord, thou Serbian Tsar Doushan, listen to
me! There is in the city of Ledyen a terrible hero named Balatchko the
Vo&iuml;vode; I know him and he knows me. Balatchko has three heads:
from one of them issues a blue flame, from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>another rushes a freezing wind. Woe to him
against whom these are directed! But if a hero withstands them it is
not difficult to slay Balatchko when his wind and flame have left him.
The Venetian king has been training him these seven years, for it has
been his intention to make use of him to annihilate the royal
wedding-party and to rescue princess Roksanda, supposing that thou
shouldst succeed in obtaining possession of her. Now it is certain that
he will send him to pursue us. Go thou thy way and I will remain behind
with three hundred well-chosen heroes, to stop the monster from
pursuing thee.&rdquo; Therefore, while the svats went on with the
beautiful Princess Roksanda, Milosh, with his three hundred comrades,
remained in the verdant forest.</p>
<p>The svats had hardly struck their tents when King Michael summoned
Vo&iuml;vode Balatchko. &ldquo;O Balatchko, my trusty servant,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;canst thou rely upon thy valour and go out against the
tsar&rsquo;s svats to bring back my daughter Roksanda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Balatchko replied: &ldquo;My lord, thou King of Ledyen! First
tell me, who was that valorous hero who achieved the great feats to
which thou didst challenge the Serbian tsar?&rdquo; The king of Ledyen
answered him: &ldquo;O Balatchko, our trusty servant! He is no hero; he
is only a youthful black Bulgarian.&rdquo; And Balatchko replied:
&ldquo;Nay, thou art mistaken; no black Bulgar is he. I know him well;
he is the Prince Milosh Vo&iuml;novitch himself, whom not even the
Serbian tsar was able to recognize through his shepherd&rsquo;s
disguise. Truly he is no ordinary hero, and not to be lightly esteemed
by any warrior, however fearless.&rdquo; Nevertheless the king
insisted: &ldquo;Go thou against the svats, O Vo&iuml;vode Balatchko!
If thou dost regain the princess, I will give her to thee for
wife!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hearing this promise, Balatchko saddled his mare
Bedevia and went in pursuit of the svats, accompanied by six hundred
Venetian cuirassiers. When they reached the forest they saw Koulash
standing in the middle of the main road and Milosh on foot behind him.
Balatchko addressed the prince, saying: &ldquo;O Milosh, evidently thou
hast waited for me!&rdquo; With this he loosed his blue flame, which,
however, only singed Milosh&rsquo;s furs; whereupon, seeing that he had
not greatly harmed the hero, he breathed his freezing wind upon him.
Koulash tumbled over and over in the dust three times, but the wind did
not affect his master. Exclaiming: &ldquo;There is something thou didst
not expect!&rdquo; Milosh hurled his six-cornered mace and it gave
Balatchko a gentle knock that tumbled him out of his saddle. Then
Milosh threw his lance and transfixed the fellow to the ground, after
which he cut off all three of his heads and threw them in
Koulash&rsquo;s bag. This done, he mounted his steed and led his three
hundred Serbians against the Venetian cuirassiers and cleft three
hundred heads, the survivors being put to flight. He then hurried on
and soon came up with the tsar, at whose feet he cast the three grim
heads of Balatchko. The tsar rejoiced to hear of his victory and gave
him one thousand ducats; then the procession resumed its march to
Prisrend. In the middle of the plain Kossovo, Milosh&rsquo;s way to the
fortress of Voutchitrn lay to the right, and he came to the tsar to
take leave of him. &ldquo;May God be with thee, my dear uncle!&rdquo;
said he. Only then did the tsar come to know that the seeming Bulgarian
was none else than his nephew Prince Milosh Vo&iuml;novitch!
Overwhelmed with joy he exclaimed: &ldquo;Is it thou, my dear Milosh?
Is it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=

<p class="first">As they sat at supper together one evening the Tsarina
Militza spoke thus unto Tsar Lazarus: &ldquo;O Lazarus, thou Serbian
Golden Crown! Thou art to go to-morrow to the battlefield of Kossovo
together with thy dukes and servants, but, alas! thou wilt leave in the
palace none who can carry to thee my missives and bring thine from
Kossovo to me. Thou takest also with thee my nine brothers Yougovitchs;
I pray thee, leave me at least one of my brothers that I may
swear<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3573src" href="#xd19e3573" name=
"xd19e3573src">1</a> by him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the tsar returned answer: &ldquo;O my lady, thou Tsarina
Militza! Which one of thy brothers wouldst thou best like me to leave
at home.&rdquo; Thereupon the tsaritza said: &ldquo;Leave me, I pray,
Boshko Yougovitch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the tsar assented: &ldquo;O my lady, Tsarina Militza! When
the morrow dawns and the sun begins to rise and the gates of the
fortress are opened, thou mayest walk out to the main gate whence the
whole army will defile with the ensigns&mdash;all cavaliers with
warrior-lances, headed by Boshko Yougovitch, who will be carrying the
flag adorned with a golden cross. Greet him in my name and tell him
that I give him leave to remain with thee at our white castle and to
yield his flag to whomsoever he may choose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the morrow dawned and the sun shone, the
fortress-gates opened and Tsarina Militza appeared <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>at
the main gate of the city, and lo! the mighty army was preparing to
defile with, in the van, the glorious cavaliers headed by Boshko
Yougovitch. Boshko was in the act of mounting his brown horse, a
splendid creature, caparisoned with golden trappings; the dropping
folds of the flag fell upon his shoulders and over his steed&rsquo;s
back. Upon the flag pole was fixed a golden apple and from the great
cross hung golden thustles which were knocking gently against
Boshko&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>Tsarina Militza approached her brother and flinging her tender arms
around his neck addressed him in her sweet voice thus: &ldquo;O my
darling brother, our tsar has presented thee to me, and desires that
thou shalt not go to Kossovo in the war. His charge to thee is: that
thou shalt give thy flag to whom thou choosest and remain at
<span class="corr" id="xd19e3586" title=
"Source: Krousharatz">Kroushevatz</span> that I may have a brother to
swear by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Boshko Yougovitch answered: &ldquo;Go back, O sister dear, to
thy white castle! I would not return, neither would I give up from my
hands this flag for the price of Kroushevatz.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e3591src" href="#xd19e3591" name="xd19e3591src">2</a> How could I
suffer my comrades to say: &lsquo;Look at the coward Boshko Yougovitch!
He dares not go to Kossovo, to shed his blood in the cause of the Holy
Cross and his orthodox faith!&rsquo;&rdquo; Saying this he disengaged
himself from his sister&rsquo;s embraces and leapt into his saddle.</p>
<p>Lo! there now comes the aged Youg-Bogdan at the head of a line of
his seven other sons! The tsarina endeavoured to stop each one in turn,
but in vain. Vo&iuml;n Yougovitch, the eighth brother, was last in the
line; he like the rest of his brothers would not listen, and as he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>passed on, the poor tsarina fell down at the
feet of the horses and swooned. The glorious Lazarus saw his loving
consort fall, and understanding the cause of her grief, he shed tears.
Glancing quickly right and left he beheld Golouban, his trusty servant,
and called to him: &ldquo;O Golouban, my faithful servant! Dismount
from thy charger, and take the tsarina gently in thy heroic arms to her
slender tower. God and I will hold thee excused from service in the
war, do thou remain at our white castle near the tsarina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this Golouban turned pale, and tears poured down his cheeks
as he dismounted from his Laboud.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3605src"
href="#xd19e3605" name="xd19e3605src">3</a> He took the tsarina in his
arms and carried her into her slender high tower as the tsar had
commanded; but this done he could not resist the desire of his heart to
go to Kossovo, so he hurried back to his charger and spurred him
swiftly on after his comrades.</p>

<p class="first">Next day, when morning dawned, lo! two ill-omened
ravens from the battlefield of Kossovo alighted upon the white tower of
the glorious Tsar Lazarus. One spake to the other: &ldquo;Is this the
home of the famed prince, Lazarus? Is there no living soul in the
castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One only within the castle heard this. Tsarina Militza walked out
upon the balcony of her tower and besought the two black ravens thus:
&ldquo;For the sake of all that ye hold dear, O ye two dark ravens!
Whence do ye come? Do ye not fly from the field of Kossovo? Saw ye
there two mighty armies? O tell me! Have they met together? Which of
them is victorious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the two ravens answered: &ldquo;Evil overtake us
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>if we do not speak truth to thee, O fair empress

<p class="first">The ravens had hardly spoken when the tsarina
perceived a horseman approaching whom she recognized. His left arm hung
helpless; he was covered with seventeen wounds; blood ran over his
steed. The tsarina called to him in accents of terror: &ldquo;Alas,
alas! Is it thou, my trusty Miloutin? Hast thou then betrayed thy tsar
on Kossovo the level field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miloutin answered slowly and with pain: &ldquo;Help me, O my
lady, to alight from my brave steed! Bathe my face with cooling water
and refresh me with rosy wine, for heavy wounds have overwhelmed
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the tsarina went to him and helped him to dismount from his
bloody steed, bathed his face with some cooling water and brought wine
unto his dried lips. When she had thus restored him somewhat, she spake
again: &ldquo;What dreadful thing has happened, O thou trusty servant,
in Kossovo that level field? Where perished the glorious Prince

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The bards invariably throw all responsibility for the
great calamity to the Serbian arms, inflicted upon them in that
celebrated battle on Kossovo, upon Vouk Brankovitch, who was one of the
sons-in-law of Tsar Lazarus. Some of our historians are convinced that
there is a great deal of truth in this <i>licencia poetica</i>, and
they point to the fact that the medi&aelig;val history of Serbia
contains many instances of such malcontents as Vouk Brankovitch who,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>seduced by fair promises from cunning Turkish
statesmen, went to Stamboul to become useful tools in the hands of
Ottoman generals, who were thereby aided in their conquests of the
Slavs of the Balkans. But the truth is that our calamity was due mainly
to the disobedience of the Serbian Lords who ruled almost independently
over Bosnia and Herzegovina. These lords failed to comply with Tsar
Lazarus&rsquo; mobilisation proclamation, and it was due to this that
the Serbian army was considerably smaller than the Turkish.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, the defeat which the Serbians sustained in that
memorable battle left a very deep impression upon the nation, and
Serbians have believed ever since that it was solely due to this
disaster that the Serbian empire was crushed by the Turk. This feeling
persisted in the hearts of the oppressed Serbians through four
centuries and was manifested in repeated insurrections against their
oppressors in the beginning of the last century under the leadership of
two Serbian princes, George Petrovitch, grandfather of the present King
Peter I Karageorgevitch, in the year 1804, and Milosh Obrenovitch in
1815. But another century had to pass ere the opportunity came for a
decisive battle by which satisfaction could be obtained for the battle
on Kossovo. This opportunity offered on the famous field of Koumanovo
in 1913, where perished more Turks than did Serbians five centuries
ago. Only then was Serbia happy! The present writer went through the
Balkan Campaigns of 1912&ndash;1913, and was a witness of glorious
deeds and feats of arms by his countrymen which, relatively speaking,
by no means yield to those of their medi&aelig;val ancestors led by
Milosh Obilitch, Marko Kralyevitch, Ban <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e3661" title="Source: Strahiyna">Strahinya</span>, and others. It
was an imposing sight when the victorious <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>Serbian army returned
to Belgrade at the conclusion of the war. The soldiers entered through
numberless triumphal gates, over some of which were huge inscriptions:
&ldquo;For Kossovo: Koumanovo&rdquo; and &ldquo;For Slivnitza:
Bregalnitza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The untiring Serbian bards have now turned their attention to the
exploits of modern heroes at Monastir, Koumanovo, Perlep (Prilip),
Scutari (Skadar), &amp;c., and they will thus immortalize for the
delight of future generations the final triumph of the Serb over the
oppressor of his race, from whom he has wrested the empire of his
valiant ancestors&mdash;if not in its entirety as under the rule of
Tsar Doushan the Powerful, yet as it was in extent in the time of Tsar
Lazarus.</p>
<p>What Tsar Lazarus lost, therefore, has now been virtually regained
by his brave countrymen under the wise leadership of our present King
Peter I. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

yet shown her face when from the heights of the mountain Avala by
Belgrade a veela called aloud upon Demitrius and Stephan, the two
brothers Yakshitchs: &ldquo;O ye brothers Yakshitchs! Ill fate hath
this morn brought to ye! See ye not that the mighty Turk has made ready
to assail the glorious town Belgrade from three sides? Hearken! I will
tell ye the pashas by name. The Vizier of Tyoopria is come with forty
thousand troops; the Pasha of Vidin leads an army of thirty thousand;
and the Pasha of Novi Bazar has brought with him twenty thousand fierce
Yanissaries! If ye will not believe, climb ye to the top of your towers
and look over upon the broad field of Belgrade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this adjuration Demitrius looked out, and saw, indeed, all
that the veela had said. If rain had fallen from the skies, no drop
would have fallen on the ground, so thick was the multitude of Turks
and their horses! He was seized with terror at the sight, and, without
pausing a moment, he ran to his stable, saddled his steed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>and,
unlocking the main gates of the fortress, rushed out, leaving the keys
in the gate. He did not slacken rein until he reached a great forest,
and by this time the sun was already high in the heavens. Dismounting
from the saddle he seated himself on the banks of the cooling river
Yahorika, and soliloquized thus: &ldquo;Alas, Demitrius, mayst thou
perish! To whose care hast thou left thy only brother
Stephan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overcome with remorse for his cowardice he would have returned to
Belgrade, but it was too late. The Turks had already entered the city
through the open gates. There was none to oppose them, and after
indulging in outrage and pillage they had carried away many captives,
among whom was Stephan Yakshitch. Him they did not behead because of
his unusual beauty, and because they were well acquainted with his
heroism, the fame of which was known far and near. They brought Stephan
to the presence of the Vizier of Tyoopria, who was so pleased to see
him that he ordered his hands to be freed, and gave him back his horse
and arms. He also held a great feast and accompanied it with the firing
of innumerable cannon. After this the Vizier of Tyoopria returned with
the whole army in triumph to Stamboul, where he brought his
distinguished prisoner into the sultan&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p class="first">The mighty Padishah was seated on his
sidjad&eacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3696src" href="#xd19e3696"
name="xd19e3696src">3</a> and after presenting Stephan the vizier took
a seat near by. Stephan made a profound obeisance and kissed the
slipper and the knee of the sultan. The sultan then invited him to a
seat near to him and spake thus: &ldquo;O heroic Stephan Yakshitch! If
thou wilt become a Turk! (may Allah favour <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>thee!) I will make thee my Grand Vizier of
Bosnia in the City of Travnik! Thou shalt have seven other viziers to
obey thy orders; I will give thee in marriage my only daughter, and
will care for thee as for my own son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Stephan answered firmly: &ldquo;O Great Padishah! Thou
mighty ruler of the world! I shall never turn Turk and renounce the
Holy Cross. Yea, even if thou offered me thy own throne! I am ready to
give my life for the holy Christian faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these bold words the sultan was very angry, and gave orders that
Stephan should be executed. But Stephan had a good friend in the Vizier
of Tyoopria, who at this juncture prayed the sultan not to give way to
his wrath. &ldquo;Do not, in the name of Allah, O my Padishah,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;have so valorous a young man beheaded! I have given him
my word of honour that thou, O Sultan, will not take his life! Deliver
him to me for ransom! I will give thee as many golden ducats as he
weighs on thy balance, and will keep him safely in my castle at
Tyoopria where, I give thee my firm faith, I will make him love the
creed of Mohammed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sultan graciously acceded to his vizier&rsquo;s request and
Stephan departed with the Turk to his province.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the vizier came to Tyoopria he invited Stephan to
participate in all the luxury of his castle, and during one whole year
he endeavoured by courtesy and kindness to convert the Serbian prince
to the Mussulman faith. Then, as all his efforts had failed, he called
together his hodjas<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3714src" href=
"#xd19e3714" name="xd19e3714src">4</a> and kadis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e3719src" href="#xd19e3719" name="xd19e3719src">5</a> as well as
all the noblemen of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>district, and these men spoke to
Stephan thus: &ldquo;O Stephan, the vizier has ordered us to convert
thee unto the true faith; if thou wilt submit to us in this thing he
will give thee in marriage his only daughter&mdash;she is more
beautiful than the white veela herself&mdash;and he will have thee to
be appointed the Grand Vizier of Novi Bazar. But if thou refused to
become a Turk, his djelat<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3726src" href=
"#xd19e3726" name="xd19e3726src">6</a> will cleave thy head
asunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Stephan answered: &ldquo;I thank ye, venerable hodgas and
kadis! But I would rather lose my life for the sake of our holy faith
and the law of our Lord Jhesu, than live to become a Turk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vizier turned sadly away and ordered his djelat to behead Prince
Stephan. But again Stephan&rsquo;s good fortune befriended him. The
Grand Vizier of Novi Bazar came to the Vizier of Tyoopria and implored
him not to behead the young man. &ldquo;Dost thou not remember,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that thou didst promise that his life should not be
taken from him? &rsquo;Twere better to deliver him to me on ransom: I
will give twice his weight in golden ducats, and I declare solemnly
that when I have him in my province of Novi Bazar, I shall not fail to
induce him to embrace Islam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vizier of Tyoopria agreed to his friend&rsquo;s offer and
Stephan was thus a second time delivered from death.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3738" class="main">Stephan at Novi Bazar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Arriving at Novi Bazar the vizier summoned his servant
Hoossein. &ldquo;Listen, Hoossein, my trusty servant!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Take thou this dearly bought prisoner, and conduct him through
the donjons, until thou comest to the twelfth; there leave him and shut
the twelve doors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181"
name="pb181">181</a>]</span>behind thee carefully, so that he shall see
neither the sun nor the moon. Methinks he will soon be willing to adopt
our Mussulman faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoossein did as he was commanded, and Stephan remained a prisoner
for half a year, when the vizier took pity on him. Summoning his only
daughter Haykoona, he said to her: &ldquo;My darling daughter, my pure
gold! Hearken to thy father&rsquo;s words! Go back to thy tower, open
thy golden cupboards, and adorn thyself with thy richest apparel. Put
on thy prettiest dress of rosy silk adorned with velvet ribbons and
golden threads, and cover all with thy gold-woven cloak. In thy right
hand take a golden apple and under thy arm take this bottle; in it is a
beverage prepared from forest plants and flowerets. It is called
&lsquo;water of oblivion&rsquo;; I have been told that he who washes
his face with it and drinks of it must hate his relatives and his
religion. Take ye these to the lowest sera&iuml;s and open the twelve
doors, closing carefully each of them in turn after thee. When thou
comest to Prince Stephan give him this wonderful bottle. He will surely
bathe his face with its contents and drink: then he will forget his
faith, embrace Islam and marry thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Turkish maiden could have wished for no greater good fortune,
for ever since she first saw the handsome Serbian prince she had felt
strange pains. In her dreams she saw nobody but him, and in the daytime
she was consumed with fevers.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3749" class="main">Stephan and the Vizier&rsquo;s
Daughter</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Therefore she complied with her father&rsquo;s wish
with alacrity, and when she reached Stephan she greeted him tenderly:
&ldquo;Hail, O Serbian Hero! May God be with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>thee!&rdquo; And the chivalrous prince returned
the greeting: &ldquo;May God help thee, O peerless Haykoona!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful maiden then said: &ldquo;O Prince Stephan, I value
thee more than my black eyes! I sorrow to see thy face thus darkened
and thy life so miserable in the prison-donjons of my father. Take this
bottle of cooling water; bathe thy heroic visage with the liquid and
drink a little of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hero took the bottle from those beauteous hands; but he was
wise! Without hesitation he shattered it against the stony wall, taking
great care that not a drop of the liquid should besprinkle him. The
Turkish maiden flushed with anger, but a moment later she composed
herself, and casting upon the prince a tender glance, she said to him
sweetly: &ldquo;Do, I pray thee, become a Turk and marry me! I love
thee more than my black eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stephan answered: &ldquo;I beseech thee, in thy Allah&rsquo;s
name, speak not so, O Princess Haykoona. I shall never turn Turk and
forget my Christian faith! Yea, I am ready always to give my life for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beauteous lady turned aside impatiently, but her anger soon
passed, and again looking tenderly at the young prince, she exclaimed
with sudden passion, &ldquo;Kiss me, O my beloved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stephan was proof against temptation, and he answered sternly:
&ldquo;O Turkish lady, may misfortune attend thee! Thou knowest that my
faith forbids that a Christian should kiss a Turk! The skies above
would burst asunder and stones would fall upon our heads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vizier&rsquo;s daughter really loved the prince, and although it
was not easy for her haughty spirit to brook such a refusal of her
advances, she presently spake again in this wise: &ldquo;O Prince
Stephan, truly I love thee more than my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>own eyes! I would not
for the entire wealth of this world be baptized, but if thou wilt
promise me thy love and wilt marry me I will even embrace the Christian
faith! Let us take much gold from my father&rsquo;s treasury and flee
together to thy glorious Belgrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the young prince sprang joyfully to his feet and
opened his arms to the beauteous maiden. He was by no means insensible
to her charms, and he exclaimed with fervour: &ldquo;Thou hast my
princely promise that I shall love thee and be faithful to
thee&mdash;as it is the duty of a true knight so to be. May the Lord
Jhesu in Heaven be my witness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the vizier&rsquo;s daughter opened the twelve doors one after
the other and the young couple soon stood in the glorious fresh air
under the sky, which was bespangled with silver stars, and radiant with
the light of the moon.</p>
<p>From the vizier&rsquo;s treasury they took three tovars of gold, and
from his stables his two best horses. And the maiden gave Stephan a
sabre studded with large diamonds&mdash;it was worth half of Novi
Bazar&mdash;saying: &ldquo;Take this sword, my darling lord: that thou
mayest not be compelled to give way to inferior heroes, if we should be
molested on our way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they mounted the horses and urged them swiftly away: in one
night they put a distance between them and the vizier&rsquo;s castle
which a caravan could not cover in less than three days and three
nights. At dawn of the next day they reached Belgrade, and Prince
Stephan immediately summoned twelve monks, who baptized the fair
Turkish maiden, after which the young couple were happily united.

<p class="first">During the long course of the imposition of Ottoman
dominion upon the suffering Christian races of the Balkans there were
always at the courts of the Christian princes malcontents whom the
cunning Turkish statesmen easily seduced from their allegiance to their
rightful lords, and to whom they extended hospitality in
Constantinople, often overwhelming them with riches and honours. In
return they have rendered most important services to the sultans in
their many campaigns, being, of course, well acquainted with the
strategic dispositions of their countrymen, and often with important
state secrets. Sometimes such traitorous men have served the Turk in
their own country by sowing the seed of dissatisfaction with their
rulers among the peasantry, assuring them that they would be better off
under Ottoman rule. The influence of such renegades prevailed upon the
peasantry in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the time of the Battle of
Kossovo (1389), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>to rise against their rulers, and they did
not participate in that memorable battle.</p>
<p>Very few instances of such treachery, however, occurred in
Montenegro, which has been from the earliest times the home of the
noblest of Serbian aristocrats and heroes, and where the adoption of
the faith of Islam, no matter for what reason, or from what motive, was
considered as the greatest cowardice of which a Christian could be
guilty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

"xd19e3825src" href="#xd19e3825" name="xd19e3825src">4</a> opposite the
mountain Dourmitor. He wrote it secretly, and secretly he dispatched it
to the hands of beauteous Vidossava, the lonely consort of Vo&iuml;vode
Momtchilo. These were the words in the book:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail Vidossava, Momtchilo&rsquo;s consort! Why dost thou
dwell in the midst of ice and snow? When thou lookest up from thy
castle walls thou seest Mount Dourmitor adorned with ice and snow, yea,
even in summer as in mid-winter; when thou lookest down, lo! thither
rushes thy turbulent River Tarra carrying on its waves wood and stones.
There are no fords, neither are there bridges to span it; around it are
only pine-trees and fragments of rock. Why shouldst thou not give
poison to thy husband or betray him unto me? Then mightest thou fly to
me on this level sea-coast in my white city on Boyana. I will gladly
espouse thee and thou shalt become my queen. Thou shalt spin silk upon
a golden spindle, sit upon silk cushions and wear velvet embroidered
with gold. And how glorious is this city of Skadar on Boyana! When thou
lookest upon the fertile slopes above the walls thou wilt see
innumerable fig-trees and olive-trees, and vineyards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>full
of grapes; when thou lookest beneath, behold! the plain will be white
with nodding wheat, and green with the verdure of the meadows. Through
the meadows green-limpid Boyana is flowing; in its stream are all kinds
of fish which thou wilt have served fresh at table when thou dost so
desire.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Vidossava had read the book she wrote a reply in
fine characters: &ldquo;My Lord, thou King Voukashin! It is not an easy
task to betray Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo, still less is it easy to poison
him. Momtchilo has a sister, by name Yevrossima, who prepares his
dishes and partakes of each before him. He has nine brothers and twelve
first cousins who pour wine into his golden cup; they always drink
before him of each draught. Also, O king! Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo
possesses a steed named Yaboutchilo; it has wings and can fly any
distance its master wishes. Nor is this all! My spouse has a sword
adorned with diamonds as big as a maiden&rsquo;s eyes; with this, he
fears no one but God. But attend to me, O King Voukashin! Gather a
numberless army together; bring thy heroes to the lake, and hide there
in the woods. It is Momtchilo&rsquo;s custom to hunt each Sunday
morning; he rides out with his nine brothers and his twelve cousins,
and attended by forty guards from his castle. On the eve of next Sunday
I will burn off Yaboutchilo&rsquo;s wings; the jewelled sword I will
dip in salted blood that Momtchilo may not be able to unsheath it: thus
thou shalt be able to vanquish him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this book reached King Voukashin&rsquo;s hands, his heart
rejoiced and he assembled a large force and marched to Herzegovina. He
marched to the lake by Momtchilo&rsquo;s castle, where he hid in the
neighbouring woods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the eve of Sunday, Momtchilo retired to his bed-chamber to rest
upon the silken cushions, when lo! his consort came to him. She did not
lay on the cushions, but stood by her spouse and her tears fell upon
his head. Feeling the warm tears upon his knightly cheeks, the
Vo&iuml;vode looked up and said: &ldquo;O Vidossava, my faithful
consort! What great trouble afflicts thee, that thou shouldst shed
tears upon my head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Vidossava answered: &ldquo;My Lord, thou Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo!
I have no trouble but for thee! I have heard tell of a marvel which I
have not seen with my own eyes. It is said that thou hast a wondrous
winged steed but I cannot believe the story. It is some evil portent,
and I fear thou wilt perish!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Momtchilo was usually cautious, but this time he fell
into the trap. &ldquo;Vidossava, my dear consort,&rdquo; said he,
tenderly, &ldquo;if that be all thy trouble I will easily console thee.
Thou shalt see the wings of my steed Tchile:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e3852src" href="#xd19e3852" name="xd19e3852src">5</a> when the
first cocks crow go down to the new stables, Tchile will then unfold
his wings, as thou wilt see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he composed himself once more to slumber. But not so
Vidossava. She watched to hear the first rooster&rsquo;s crow, and at
the sound she sprang to her feet, lit a lantern and a candle, took some
fat of mutton and some tar, and hurried to the stables. And behold! she
saw Yaboutchilo unfold a pair of wings which reached down to his hoofs.
Vidossava anointed the pinions with the fat and tar and set fire to
them with the flame of her candle. What did not burn she bound tightly
under the belt of the steed. This done, she, the youthful one, went
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>to the armoury and dipped Momtchilo&rsquo;s
favourite sword into salted blood. Then she returned to her
consort&rsquo;s chamber.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3865" class="main">Momtchilo&rsquo;s Dream</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At daybreak Momtchilo awoke and spake thus to
Vidossava: &ldquo;Vidossava, my beloved spouse! I have had this night a
strange dream: there appeared suddenly a cloud of fog from the accursed
land of Vassoye and wrapped itself round Dourmitor. I rode through the
cloud with my nine darling brothers and twelve first-cousins, together
with my forty guards. In that fog, O my darling Vidossava! we lost
sight of each other, never to meet again! God alone knows what this
dream means, but I have a presentiment that some evil will befall us
soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vidossava endeavoured to reassure her lord. &ldquo;Do not fear, my
darling lord!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;dreams are false, God is
true!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3872" class="main">The Ambuscade</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Momtchilo attired himself for hunting and walked out
from his white tower to the courtyard, where his nine brothers, twelve
cousins, and forty guards awaited him. His spouse led to him his
Yaboutchilo; he sprang to the saddle, and without more ado rode with
his followers to the hunt. All unsuspecting, they reached the lake,
when suddenly a great force surrounded them. Momtchilo grasped his
sword, but, alas! he was unable to unsheathe it. Then he exclaimed
bitterly: &ldquo;Hark, my beloved brethren! My consort Vidossava has
betrayed me; give me a sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speedily his brothers obeyed; they gave him the best <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>sword they had. Then Momtchilo said again:
&ldquo;Listen, my beloved brothers: ye shall attack the wings of the
army and I will storm it in the centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God adored, what a mighty wonder! &lsquo;Would that some from among
ye, brethren,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3882src" href="#xd19e3882"
name="xd19e3882src">6</a> could have been there to see: how
Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo wielded his sword and cleared his way through
the press of his foes!&rsquo; Howbeit, more were crushed by Yaboutchilo
than by the hero&rsquo;s sword! But, alas! a sad misfortune had
befallen him: when he had gained clear of the foe his brothers&rsquo;
nine black steeds followed after him; but their saddles were empty!</p>
<p>When Momtchilo saw this his heroic heart burst from great sorrow for
the loss of his nine beloved brothers: his sword-arm dropped limp at
his side, and knowing that he could fight no more, he spurred
Yaboutchilo, intending that he should unfold his wings and fly to his
castle.</p>
<p>But, alas! for the first time his charger did not respond to the
spur. Then Momtchilo spake reproachfully thus: &ldquo;O Yaboutchilo,
may wolves devour thee! Many times hast thou flown from here merely in
pastime, and now when I am in sore straits thou wilt not
fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the steed answered, neighing: &ldquo;My Lord, mighty
Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo! Do not curse me, nor try to force me further.
To-day I cannot fly! May God punish thy Vidossava! Last night she burnt
the pinions of my two wings. What did not burn she tied tightly under
my belt. O my beloved master! thou hadst better escape as thou mayest.
I cannot help thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Momtchilo heard this, tears fell down his heroic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>visage. He alighted heavily from his well-loved
Yaboutchilo; after a last caress he gathered himself together, and in
three leaps he found himself before the portals of his castle. And lo!
the massive gates were closed and locked.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3896" class="main">Brother and Sister</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Seeing this, Momtchilo called aloud upon his sister:
&ldquo;O Yevrossima, my darling sister! Stretch down to me a roll of
linen that I may climb the castle wall and escape ere my pursuers come
up with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yevrossima heard the appeal and answered through copious tears:
&ldquo;Alas, my darling brother, thou Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo! How can I
drop down to thee a length of white linen, seeing that my
sister-in-law, thine own faithless Vidossava, hath bound my hair to a
beam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But sisters have soft hearts for their brothers,<a class="noteref"
id="xd19e3904src" href="#xd19e3904" name="xd19e3904src">7</a> and
Yevrossima, for the sake of her only brother, jerked her head with such
force that she left her hair on the beam; then she seized a length of
linen, made one end fast, and threw the other end over the wall from
the rampart. Momtchilo seized the linen and quickly climbed almost to
the top of the rampart. He was on the point of springing into the
fortress when his faithless spouse ran thither swiftly and, with a
sharp sword, cut the linen above Momtchilo&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>By this time the forces of Voukashin had come up, and Momtchilo was
precipitated upon their swords and lances. Seeing the hero fall, the
king hastened to the spot, and with a fierce thrust ran him through the
heart. So fiercely did he lunge that the end of the sword penetrated
the wall. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=

<h3 id="xd19e3912" class="main">The Death of Momtchilo</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo was a rare hero, and he was
able to speak these last words to King Voukashin: &ldquo;My last
request to thee, O King Voukashin, is that thou shouldst not marry my
faithless Vidossava, for she will betray thee also. To-day she hath
betrayed me to thee; to-morrow she will deal with thee in like manner!
Far better would it be to marry my dear sister Yevrossima, the
loveliest of maidens. She will always be faithful to thee and will bear
thee a hero like unto myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This spake Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo, struggling with pale death: this
he said and his soul flew heavenward.</p>
<p>The gates of the castle were now opened, and the faithless Vidossava
came out to welcome King Voukashin. After she had greeted him she led
the way to her white tower and gave him a seat at her golden table. She
offered him fine wines and many lordly dishes. Then she went to the
armoury and brought Momtchilo&rsquo;s armour and weapons. But,
marvellous to relate! Momtchilo&rsquo;s helmet, which fitted him
closely, fell down to King Voukashin&rsquo;s shoulders. One of
Momtchilo&rsquo;s top-boots was big enough for King Voukashin&rsquo;s
two feet. Momtchilo&rsquo;s golden rings were too large for three of
King Voukashin&rsquo;s fingers together. Momtchilo&rsquo;s sabre was
one whole yard too long when King Voukashin tried it on his belt!</p>

<p class="first">Seeing all this, King Voukashin exclaimed:
&ldquo;Alas! Woe is me! May God forgive me! What a faithless monster
this youthful Vidossava must be to betray such a hero, whose equal
would be vainly sought throughout the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>whole world! How
could I, the wretched one, expect such a woman to be faithful to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he called loudly to his servants, who took Vidossava and
bound her fair limbs to the tails of four horses and drove them from
the castle Pirlitor. Thus, dreadful fate! she was torn to pieces
alive.</p>
<p>Then the king pillaged Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo&rsquo;s castle and led
away Yevrossima to his palace at Skadar on Boyana. Later, he deserved
her love and married her, and she bore unto him Marko and Andrias.
Truly Marko inherited the heroism of Vo&iuml;vode Momtchilo, and thus
his uncle&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3932" class="main">Historical Note</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Primitive as may be the customs illustrated in this
ballad of the fourteenth century, it is undoubtedly worthy of a place
in my collection. It was taken down by Vouk St. Karadgitch from the
lips of the Serbian bard, and I cannot sufficiently express my regret
for my inability to convey in English the beautiful and audacious
similes and the eloquent figures of speech which adorn the
original.</p>
<p>The French medi&aelig;val troubadour rarely chose as his theme the
faithlessness of women; probably because incidents like the one
described in our ballad were either unknown or too common to be
considered interesting. But if the Serbian bards did not, excepting in
this rare instance, sing of the fickleness and treachery of the weaker
sex, it was that Serbian public opinion could not suffer the
contemplation of faithlessness on the part of either husband or wife.
No doubt the bard, wandering from one monastery to another, found in
some chronicle a few facts concerning the marriage of King Voukashin
which he elaborated much as did the French troubadour who dealt
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>similarly with the slender historic fact
relative to the battle at Ronceval. The public opinion of the epoch is
reflected in the barbarous punishment which the bard, moved by his
austerity, inflicts upon Vidossava. It is interesting to note that in
my researches I have not found one ballad in which faithlessness on the
part of a husband occurs.</p>
<p>In the ballads concerning the royal Prince Marko we see that he was
always chivalrous toward women, especially toward widows and oppressed
maidens, irrespective of their social position or their religion. He is
willing to succour Turkish maidens, for whom he is ready to jeopardize
his life. In the ballad entitled &ldquo;The Captivity and Marriage of
Stephan Yakshitch&rdquo; the bard tells of advances made to Stephan by
a passionate Turkish maiden, which he repels with indignation at the
mere idea of an alliance between a Christian and a Mussulman woman.
King Voukashin might have corresponded with Vo&iuml;vode
Momtchilo&rsquo;s wife previous to her marriage, but if so it must have
been rather a political attachment than an affair of the heart.

tears down thy cheeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, amid her sobs, Beata Maria said: &ldquo;O my dear

since I am just come from India&mdash;from India, that accursed
country? In that degraded land there is utter lawlessness: the common
people do not respect their superiors; children do not obey their

<p>The Thunderer Elias returned answer: &ldquo;O sister dear, thou
Beata Maria! Wipe those tears from thy tender face! When we have
divided these treasures we will go to the divan unto our Almighty
creator. Him we will pray, the Truthful One, that He may, in His

therefrom, neither abundant rain nor soft dew. Also, the silvery

shall be a heavy drought, and neither wheat nor wine shall grow, yea,
not as much as is needful for the Holy Mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beata Maria was comforted, and wiped away the tears from her
milk-white face. And the saints turned again to the division of the
treasures: Peter chose wine and wheat and the Keys of the Heavenly
Empire; Elias chose the lightning and thunder; Panthelias, great heats;

ballad is in all probability a remnant of the mythologic traces of a
great prehistoric catastrophe, and it illustrates more than any other
ancient memorial of the poetic Serbian people, the striking similarity
in the beliefs of nations.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

opening might perplex many readers if it were not explained that the
commotion is not caused by the saints, but is due to the device,
familiar to a Serbian audience, whereby the bard gives his ballad an
effective start, and obtains the close attention of his peasant
hearers.</p>

<p class="first">The following poems are reprinted here from Sir John
Bowring&rsquo;s <i>Servian Popular Poetry</i>, London, 1827. These
translations will serve to give to English readers some idea of the
form of the national decasyllabic verse from which the matter of the

<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Brothers three combined to build a fortress,</p>
<p class="line">Brothers three, the brothers Mrnyavtchevitch,</p>
<p class="line">Kraly Vukashin<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4037src"
href="#xd19e4037" name="xd19e4037src">2</a> was the eldest brother;</p>
<p class="line">And the second was Uglesha-Voivode;</p>
<p class="line">And the third, the youngest brother Go&iuml;ko.</p>
<p class="line">Full three years they labour&rsquo;d at the
fortress,</p>
<p class="line">Skadra&rsquo;s fortress on Boyana&rsquo;s river;</p>
<p class="line">Full three years three hundred workmen
labour&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="line">Vain th&rsquo; attempt to fix the wall&rsquo;s
foundation.</p>
<p class="line">Vainer still to elevate the fortress:</p>
<p class="line">Whatsoe&rsquo;er at eve had raised the workmen</p>
<p class="line">Did the veela raze ere dawn of morning.</p>
<p class="line">When the fourth year had begun its labours,</p>
<p class="line">Lo! the veela from the forest-mountain</p>
<p class="line">Call&rsquo;d&mdash;&ldquo;Thou King Vukashin! vain
thine efforts!</p>
<p class="line">Vain thine efforts&mdash;all thy treasures wasting!</p>
<p class="line">Never, never, wilt thou build the fortress,</p>
<p class="line">If thou find not two same-titled beings,</p>
<p class="line">If thou find not Stoyan and Stoyana: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">And these two&mdash;these two young twins so
loving,</p>
<p class="line">They must be immured in the foundation.</p>
<p class="line">Thus alone will the foundations serve thee:</p>
<p class="line">Thus alone can ye erect your fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">When Vukashin heard the veela&rsquo;s language,</p>
<p class="line">Soon he call&rsquo;d to Dessimir, his servant:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Listen, Dessimir, my trusty servant!</p>
<p class="line">Thou hast been my trusty servant ever;</p>
<p class="line">Thou shalt be my son from this day onward.</p>
<p class="line">Fasten thou my coursers to my chariot:</p>
<p class="line">Load it with six lasts of golden treasures:</p>
<p class="line">Travel through the whole wide world, and bring me,</p>
<p class="line">Bring me back those two same-titled beings:</p>
<p class="line">Bring me back that pair of twins so loving:</p>
<p class="line">Bring me hither Stoyan and Stoyana:</p>
<p class="line">Steal them, if with gold thou canst not buy them.</p>
<p class="line">Bring them here to Skadar on Boyana<a class="noteref"

<p class="line">We&rsquo;ll inter them in the wall&rsquo;s
foundation:</p>
<p class="line">So the wall&rsquo;s foundations will be
strengthened:</p>
<p class="line">So we shall build up our Skadra&rsquo;s
fortress.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Dessimir obey&rsquo;d his master&rsquo;s mandate;</p>
<p class="line">Fasten&rsquo;d, straight, the horses to the
chariot;</p>
<p class="line">Fill&rsquo;d it with six lasts of golden treasures;</p>
<p class="line">Through the whole wide world the trusty servant</p>
<p class="line">Wander&rsquo;d&mdash;asking for these same-named
beings&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">For the twins&mdash;for Stoyan and Stoyana;</p>
<p class="line">Full three years he sought them,&mdash;sought them
vainly:</p>
<p class="line">Nowhere could he find these same-named beings:</p>
<p class="line">Nowhere found he Stoyan and Stoyana.</p>
<p class="line">Then he hasten&rsquo;d homeward to his master;</p>
<p class="line">Gave the king his horses and his chariot; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Gave him his six lasts of golden treasures:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here, my sov&rsquo;reign, are thy steeds and
chariot:</p>
<p class="line">Here thou hast thy lasts of golden treasures:</p>
<p class="line">Nowhere could I find those same-named beings:</p>
<p class="line">Nowhere found I Stoyan and Stoyana.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When Vukashin had dismiss&rsquo;d his servant,</p>
<p class="line">Straight he call&rsquo;d his builder master Rado.</p>
<p class="line">Rado call&rsquo;d on his three hundred workmen;</p>
<p class="line">And they built up Skadar on Boyana;</p>
<p class="line">But, at even did the veela raze it:</p>
<p class="line">Vainly did they raise the wall&rsquo;s foundation;</p>
<p class="line">Vainly seek to build up Skadra&rsquo;s fortress.</p>
<p class="line">And the veela, from the mountain-forest,</p>
<p class="line">Cried, &ldquo;Vukashin, listen! listen to me!</p>
<p class="line">Thou dost spill thy wealth, and waste thy labour:</p>
<p class="line">Vainly seek&rsquo;st to fix the wall&rsquo;s
foundations;</p>
<p class="line">Vainly seek&rsquo;st to elevate the fortress.</p>
<p class="line">Listen now to me! Ye are three brothers:</p>
<p class="line">Each a faithful wife at home possesses:&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Her who comes to-morrow to Boyana,</p>
<p class="line">Her who brings the rations to the workmen&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Her immure deep, down, in the wall&rsquo;s
foundations:&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">So shall the foundations fix them firmly:</p>
<p class="line">So shall thou erect Boyana&rsquo;s fortress.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When the king Vukashin heard the veela,</p>
<p class="line">Both his brothers speedily he summon&rsquo;d:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Hear my words, now hear my words, my
brothers!</p>
<p class="line">From the forest-hill the veela told me,</p>
<p class="line">That we should no longer waste our treasures</p>
<p class="line">In the vain attempt to raise the fortress</p>
<p class="line">On a shifting, insecure foundation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Said the veela of the forest-mountain,</p>
<p class="line">Each of you a faithful wife possesses;</p>
<p class="line">Each a faithful bride that keeps your dwellings:</p>
<p class="line">Her who to the fortress comes to-morrow,</p>
<p class="line">Her who brings their rations to the workmen&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Her immure within the wall&rsquo;s foundations;</p>
<p class="line">So will the foundations bear the fortress:</p>
<p class="line">So Boyana&rsquo;s fortress be erected.</p>
<p class="line">Now then, brothers! in God&rsquo;s holy presence</p>
<p class="line">Let each swear to keep the awful secret;</p>
<p class="line">Leave to chance whose fate &rsquo;twill be
to-morrow</p>
<p class="line">First to wend her way to Skadar&rsquo;s
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">And each brother swore, in God&rsquo;s high
presence.</p>
<p class="line">From his wife to keep the awful secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When the night had on the earth descended,</p>
<p class="line">Each one hastened to his own white dwelling;</p>
<p class="line">Each one shared the sweet repast of evening;</p>
<p class="line">Each one sought his bed of quiet slumber.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Lo! there happen&rsquo;d then a wond&rsquo;rous
marvel!</p>
<p class="line">First, Vukashin on his oath he trampled,</p>
<p class="line">Whisp&rsquo;ring to his wife the awful secret:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Shelter thee! my faithful wife! be
shelter&rsquo;d!</p>
<p class="line">Go not thou to-morrow to Boyana!</p>
<p class="line">Bring not to the workmen food to-morrow!</p>
<p class="line">Else, my fair! thy early life &rsquo;twill cost
thee:</p>
<p class="line">And beneath the walls they will immure thee!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">On his oath, too, did Uglesha trample!</p>
<p class="line">And he gave his wife this early warning:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Be not thou betray&rsquo;d, sweet love! to
danger!</p>
<p class="line">Go not thou to-morrow to Boyana! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Carry not their rations to the workmen!</p>
<p class="line">Else in earliest youth thy friend might lose thee!</p>
<p class="line">Thou might be immured in the foundation!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Faithful to his oath, young Go&iuml;ko
whisper&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="line">Not a breath to warn his lovely consort.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When the morning dawn&rsquo;d upon the morrow,</p>
<p class="line">All the brothers roused them at the day-break,</p>
<p class="line">And each sped, as wont, to the Boyana.</p>
<p class="line">Now, behold! two young and noble women;</p>
<p class="line">They&mdash;half-sisters&mdash;they, the eldest
sisters&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">One is bringing up her snow-bleach&rsquo;d linen,</p>
<p class="line">Yet once more in summer sun to bleach it.</p>
<p class="line">See! she comes on to the bleaching meadows;</p>
<p class="line">There she stops&mdash;she comes not one step
further.</p>
<p class="line">Lo! the second, with a red-clay pitcher;</p>
<p class="line">Lo! she comes&mdash;she fills it at the streamlet;</p>
<p class="line">There she talks with other
women&mdash;lingers&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Yes! she lingers&mdash;comes not one step farther.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Go&iuml;ko&rsquo;s youthful wife at home is
tarrying,</p>
<p class="line">For she has an infant in the cradle</p>
<p class="line">Not a full moon old; the little nursling:</p>
<p class="line">But the moment of repast approaches;</p>
<p class="line">And her aged mother then bestirs her;</p>
<p class="line">Fain would call the serving-maid, and bid her</p>
<p class="line">Take the noon-tide meal to the Boyana.</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Nay, not so!&rdquo; said the young wife of
Go&iuml;ko;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Stay, sit down in peace, I pray thee,
mother!</p>
<p class="line">Rock the little infant in his cradle:</p>
<p class="line">I myself will bear the food to Skadra.</p>
<p class="line">In the sight of God it were a scandal, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">An affront and shame among all people,</p>
<p class="line">If, of three, no one were found to bear it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">So she staid at home, the aged mother,</p>
<p class="line">And she rock&rsquo;d the nursling in the cradle.</p>
<p class="line">Then arose the youthful wife of Go&iuml;ko;</p>
<p class="line">Gave them the repast, and bade them forward.</p>
<p class="line">Call&rsquo;d around her all the serving maidens;</p>
<p class="line">When they reach&rsquo;d Boyana&rsquo;s flowing
river,</p>
<p class="line">They were seen by Mrnyavtchevitch Go&iuml;ko,</p>
<p class="line">On his youthful wife, heart-rent, he threw him;</p>
<p class="line">Flung his strong right arm around her body;</p>
<p class="line">Kiss&rsquo;d a thousand times her snowy forehead:</p>
<p class="line">Burning tears stream&rsquo;d swiftly from his
eyelids,</p>
<p class="line">And he spoke in melancholy language:</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O my wife, my own! my full
heart&rsquo;s-sorrow!</p>
<p class="line">Didst thou never dream that thou must perish?</p>
<p class="line">Why hast thou our little one abandoned?</p>
<p class="line">Who will bathe our little one, thou absent?</p>
<p class="line">Who will bare the breast to feed the
nursling?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">More, and more, and more, he fain would utter;</p>
<p class="line">But the king allow&rsquo;d it not. Vukashin,</p>
<p class="line">By her white hand seizes her, and summons</p>
<p class="line">Master Rado,&mdash;he the master-builder;</p>
<p class="line">And he summons his three hundred workmen.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">But the young espoused one smiles, and dreams it</p>
<p class="line">All a laughing jest,&mdash;no fear o&rsquo;ercame
her.</p>
<p class="line">Gathering round her, the three hundred workmen</p>
<p class="line">Pile the stones and pile the beams about her.</p>
<p class="line">They have now immured her to the girdle. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Higher rose the walls and beams, and higher;</p>
<p class="line">Then the wretch first saw the fate prepared her,</p>
<p class="line">And she shriek&rsquo;d aloud in her despair;</p>
<p class="line">In her woe implored her husband&rsquo;s brothers:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Can ye think of God?&mdash;have ye no pity?</p>
<p class="line">Can ye thus immure me, young and healthful?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">But in vain, in vain were her entreaties;</p>
<p class="line">And her brothers left her thus imploring.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Shame and fear succeeded then to censure,</p>
<p class="line">And she piteously invoked her husband:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Can it, can it be, my lord and husband,</p>
<p class="line">That so young, thou, reckless, would&rsquo;st immure
me?</p>
<p class="line">Let us go and seek my aged mother:</p>
<p class="line">Let us go&mdash;my mother she is wealthy:</p>
<p class="line">She will buy a slave,&mdash;a man or woman,</p>
<p class="line">To be buried in the wall&rsquo;s
foundations.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When the mother-wife&mdash;the wife and mother,</p>
<p class="line">Found her earnest plaints and prayers neglected,</p>
<p class="line">She address&rsquo;d herself to Neimar Rado:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e4448src" href="#xd19e4448" name=
"xd19e4448src">4</a></p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, my brother, Neimar
Rado,</p>
<p class="line">Leave a window for this snowy bosom,</p>
<p class="line">Let this snowy bosom heave it freely;</p>
<p class="line">When my voiceless Yovo shall come near me,</p>
<p class="line">When he comes, O let him drain my bosom!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Rado bade the workmen all obey her,</p>
<p class="line">Leave a window for that snowy bosom,</p>
<p class="line">Let that snowy bosom heave it freely</p>
<p class="line">When her voiceless Yovo shall come near her,</p>
<p class="line">When he comes, he&rsquo;ll drink from out her
bosom.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Once again she cried to Neimar Rado,</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Neimar Rado! In God&rsquo;s name, my
brother!</p>
<p class="line">Leave for these mine eyes a little window,</p>
<p class="line">That these eyes may see our own white dwelling,</p>
<p class="line">When my Yovo shall be brought toward me,</p>
<p class="line">When my Yovo shall be carried homeward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Rado bade the workmen all obey her,</p>
<p class="line">Leave for those bright eyes a little window,</p>
<p class="line">That her eyes may see her own white dwelling,</p>
<p class="line">When they bring her infant Yovo to her,</p>
<p class="line">When they take the infant Yovo homeward.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">So they built the heavy wall about her,</p>
<p class="line">And then brought the infant in his cradle,</p>
<p class="line">Which a long, long while his mother suckled.</p>
<p class="line">Then her voice grew feeble&mdash;then was silent:</p>
<p class="line">Still the stream flow&rsquo;d forth and nursed the
infant:</p>
<p class="line">Full a year he hung upon her bosom;</p>
<p class="line">Still the stream flow&rsquo;d forth&mdash;and still it
floweth.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4513src" href="#xd19e4513" name=

<p class="line">Near each other grew two verdant larches,</p>
<p class="line">And, between, a high and slender fir-tree:</p>
<p class="line">Not two larches were they&mdash;not two larches,</p>
<p class="line">Not a high and slender fir between them&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">They were brothers, children of one mother.</p>
<p class="line">One was Paul; the other brother, Radool,</p>
<p class="line">And, between them, Yelitza, their sister.</p>
<p class="line">Cordial was the love her brothers bore her;</p>
<p class="line">Many a token of affection gave her,</p>
<p class="line">Many a splendid gift and many a trifle,</p>
<p class="line">And at last a knife, in silver hafted,</p>
<p class="line">And adorn&rsquo;d with gold, they gave their
sister.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When the youthful wife of Paul had heard it,</p>
<p class="line">Jealousy swell&rsquo;d up within her bosom:</p>
<p class="line">And she call&rsquo;d, enraged, to Radool&rsquo;s
lady:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Sister mine! thou in the Lord my sister,</p>
<p class="line">Dost thou know some plant of demon-virtue,</p>
<p class="line">Which may bring our sister to perdition?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Radool&rsquo;s wife her sister swiftly answered:</p>

sister?</p>
<p class="line">Of such cursed weeds I know not.&mdash;Did I,</p>
<p class="line">Never would I tell thee of them, never;</p>
<p class="line">For my brothers love me; yes! they love me&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">To their love full many a gift bears
witness.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">When Paul&rsquo;s youthful wife had heard her
sister,</p>
<p class="line">To the steed she hastened in the meadow,</p>
<p class="line">Gave the steed a mortal wound, and hurried</p>
<p class="line">To her husband, whom she thus accosted:&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Evil is the love thou bear&rsquo;st thy sister,

<p class="line">And thy gifts are worse than wasted to her;</p>
<p class="line">She has stabb&rsquo;d thy courser in the
meadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Paul inquired of Yelitza, his sister,</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Why this deed, as God shall recompense
thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">High and loudly, then the maid protested:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;By my life, it was not I, my brother;</p>
<p class="line">By my life and by thy life, I swear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">And the brother doubted not his sister.</p>
<p class="line">Which when Paul&rsquo;s young wife perceived, at
even</p>
<p class="line">To the garden secretly she hasten&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">Wrung the neck of Paul&rsquo;s grey noble
falcon,&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">To her husband sped she then and told him:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Evil is the love thou bear&rsquo;st thy

thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas not I, upon my life, my brother;</p>
<p class="line">On my life and thine, I did not do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">And the brother still believed his sister.</p>
<p class="line">When the youthful bride of Paul discover&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="line">This, she slunk at evening,&mdash;evening&rsquo;s
meal-time,</p>
<p class="line">Stole the golden knife, and with it murder&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">Murder&rsquo;d her poor infant in the cradle!</p>
<p class="line">And when morning&rsquo;s dawning brought the
morning,</p>
<p class="line">She aroused her husband by her screaming</p>
<p class="line">Shrieking woe; she tore her cheeks, exclaiming:</p>

girdle.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Up sprang Paul, like one possess&rsquo;d by
madness:</p>
<p class="line">To the upper floor he hastened wildly;</p>
<p class="line">There his sister on her mats was sleeping,</p>
<p class="line">And the golden knife beneath her pillow</p>
<p class="line">Swift he seized the golden knife,&mdash;and drew
it&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Drew it, panting, from its silver scabbard;&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">It was damp with blood&mdash;&rsquo;twas red and
gory!</p>
<p class="line">When the noble Paul saw this, he seized her,&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Seized her by her own bright hand and cursed her:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Let the curse of God be on thee, sister!</p>
<p class="line">Thou didst murder, too, my favourite courser;</p>
<p class="line">Thou didst murder, too, my noble falcon;</p>
<p class="line">But thou should&rsquo;st have spared the helpless
baby.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Higher yet his sister swore, and louder&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas not I, upon my life, my brother;</p>
<p class="line">On my life and on thy life, I swear it!</p>
<p class="line">But if thou wilt disregard my swearing,</p>
<p class="line">Take me to the open fields&mdash;the desert;</p>
<p class="line">Bind thy sister to the tails of horses;</p>
<p class="line">Let four horses tear my limbs asunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">But the brother trusted not his sister:</p>
<p class="line">Furiously he seized her white hand&mdash;bore her</p>
<p class="line">To the distant fields&mdash;the open desert:</p>
<p class="line">To the tails of four fierce steeds he bound her,</p>
<p class="line">And he drove them forth across the desert;&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">But, where&rsquo;er a drop of blood fell from her,</p>
<p class="line">There a flower sprang up,&mdash;a fragrant
flow&rsquo;ret;</p>
<p class="line">Where her body fell when dead and mangled,</p>
<p class="line">There a church arose from out the desert.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little time was spent, ere fatal sickness</p>
<p class="line">Fell upon Paul&rsquo;s youthful wife;&mdash;the
sickness</p>
<p class="line">Nine long years lay on her,&mdash;heavy sickness!</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Midst her bones the matted dog-grass
sprouted,</p>
<p class="line">And amidst it nestled angry serpents,</p>
<p class="line">Which, though hidden, drank her eyelight&rsquo;s
brightness.</p>
<p class="line">Then she mourn&rsquo;d her misery&mdash;mourn&rsquo;d
despairing;</p>
<p class="line">Thus she spoke unto her lord and husband:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;O convey me, Paul, my lord and husband!</p>
<p class="line">To thy sister&rsquo;s church convey me swiftly;</p>
<p class="line">For that church, perchance, may heal and save
me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">So, when Paul had heard his wife&rsquo;s petition,</p>
<p class="line">To his sister&rsquo;s church he swiftly bore her.</p>
<p class="line">Hardly had they reach&rsquo;d the church&rsquo;s
portal,</p>
<p class="line">When a most mysterious voice address&rsquo;d them:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Come not here, young woman! come not hither!</p>
<p class="line">For this church can neither heal nor save
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Bitter was her anguish when she heard it;</p>
<p class="line">And her lord the woman thus entreated:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;In the name of God! my lord! my husband!</p>
<p class="line">Never, never bear me to our dwelling.</p>
<p class="line">Bind me to the wild steeds&rsquo; tails, and drive
them;</p>
<p class="line">Drive them in the immeasurable desert;</p>
<p class="line">Let them tear my wretched limbs asunder.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Paul then listened to his wife&rsquo;s entreaties:</p>
<p class="line">To the tails of four wild steeds he bound her;</p>
<p class="line">Drove them forth across the mighty desert.</p>
<p class="line">Wheresoe&rsquo;er a drop of blood fell from her,</p>
<p class="line">There sprang up the rankest thorns and nettles.</p>
<p class="line">Where her body fell, when dead, the waters</p>
<p class="line">Rush&rsquo;d and formed a lake both still and stagnant.

<p class="line">O&rsquo;er the lake there swam a small black

<p class="line">By his side a golden cradle floated:</p>

<h3 id="xd19e4992" class="main">I. The Ram with the Golden Fleece</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time when a certain hunter went to the
mountains to hunt, there came toward him a ram with golden fleece. The
hunter took his rifle to shoot it, but the ram rushed at him and,
before he could fire, pierced him with its horns and he fell dead. A
few days later some of his friends found his body; they knew not who
had killed him and they took the body home and interred it. The
hunter&rsquo;s wife hung up the rifle on the wall in her cottage, and
when her son grew up he begged his mother to let him take it and go
hunting. She, however, would not consent, saying: &ldquo;You must never
ask me again to give you that rifle! It did not save your
father&rsquo;s life, and do you wish that it should be the cause of
your death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, however, the youth took the rifle secretly and went out
into the forest to hunt. Very soon the same ram rushed out of a thicket
and said: &ldquo;I killed your father; now it is your turn!&rdquo; This
frightened the youth, and ejaculating: &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; he
pressed the trigger of his rifle and, lo! the ram fell dead.</p>
<p>The youth was exceedingly glad to have killed the golden-fleeced
ram, for there was not another like it throughout the land. He took off
its skin and carried the fleece home, feeling very proud of his
prowess. By and by the news spread over the country till it reached the
Court, and the king ordered the young hunter to bring him the
ram&rsquo;s skin, so that he might see what kind of beasts were to be
found in his forests. When the youth brought the skin to the king, the
latter said to him: &ldquo;Ask whatever you like for this skin, and I
will give you what you ask!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>But the youth answered:
&ldquo;I would not sell it for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that the prime minister was an uncle of the young
hunter, but he was not his friend; on the contrary, he was his greatest
enemy. So he said to the king: &ldquo;As he does not wish to sell you
the skin, set him something to do which is surely impossible!&rdquo;
The king called the youth back and ordered him to plant a vineyard and
to bring him, in seven days&rsquo; time, some new wine from it. The
youth began to weep and implored that he might be excused from such an
impossible task; but the king insisted, saying: &ldquo;If you do not
obey me within seven days, your head shall be cut off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5004">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5005" class="main">The Youth finds a Friend</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Still weeping, the youth went home and told his mother
all about his audience with the king, and she answered: &ldquo;Did I
not tell you, my son, that that rifle would cost you your life?&rdquo;
In deep sorrow and bewilderment the youth went out of the village and
walked a long way into the wood. Suddenly a girl appeared before him
and asked: &ldquo;Why do you weep, my brother?&rdquo; And he answered,
somewhat angrily: &ldquo;Go your way! You cannot help me!&rdquo; He
then went on, but the maiden followed him, and again begged him to tell
her the reason of his tears, &ldquo;for perhaps,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I may, after all, be able to help you.&rdquo; Then he stopped
and said: &ldquo;I will tell you, but I know that God alone can help
me.&rdquo; And then he told her all that had happened to him, and about
the task he had been set to do. When she heard the story, she said:
&ldquo;Do not fear, my brother, but go and ask the king to say exactly
where he would like the vineyard planted, and then have it dug in
perfectly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>straight lines. Next you must go and take a bag
with a sprig of basil in it, and lie down to sleep in the place where
the vineyard is to be, and in seven days you will see that there are
ripe grapes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Why do you weep, my brother?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He returned home and told his mother how he had met a maiden who had
told him to do a ridiculous thing. His mother, however, said earnestly:
&ldquo;Go, go, my son, do as the maiden bade; you cannot be in a worse
case anyhow.&rdquo; So he went to the king as the girl had directed
him, and the king gratified his wish. However, he was still very sad
when he went to lie down in the indicated place with his sprig of
basil.</p>
<p>When he awoke next morning he saw that the vines were already
planted; on the second morning they were clothed with leaves; and, by
the seventh day, they bore ripe grapes. Notwithstanding the
girl&rsquo;s promise the youth was surprised to find ripe grapes at a
time of year when they were nowhere to be found; but he gathered them,
made wine, and taking a basketful of the ripe fruit with him, went to
the king.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5021" class="main">The Second Task</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When he reached the palace, the king and the whole
court were amazed. The prime minister said: &ldquo;We must order him to
do something absolutely impossible!&rdquo; and advised the king to
command the youth to build a castle of elephants&rsquo; tusks.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this cruel order the youth went home weeping and told
his mother what had transpired, adding: &ldquo;This, my mother, is
utterly impossible!&rdquo; But the mother again advised him, and said:
&ldquo;Go, my son, beyond the village; may be you will again meet that
maiden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth obeyed, and, indeed, as soon as he came to the place where
he had found the girl before, she appeared <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>before him and said: &ldquo;You are again sad
and tearful, my brother!&rdquo; And he began to complain of the second
impossible task which the king had set him to perform. Hearing this,
the girl said: &ldquo;This will also be easy; but first go to the king
and ask him to give you a ship with three hundred barrels of wine and
as many kegs of brandy, and also twenty carpenters. Then, when you
arrive at such and such a place, which you will find between two
mountains, dam the water there, and pour into it all the wine and
brandy. Elephants will come down to that spot to drink water, and will
get drunk and fall on the ground. Then your carpenters must at once cut
off their tusks, and carry them to the place where the king wishes his
castle to be built. There you may all lie down to sleep, and within
seven days the castle will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the youth heard this, he hurried home, and told his mother all
about the plan of the maiden. The mother was quite confident, and
counselled her son to do everything as directed by the maiden. So he
went to the king and asked him for the ship, the three hundred barrels
of wine and brandy, as well as the twenty carpenters; and the king gave
him all he wanted. Next he went where the girl had told him, and did
everything she had advised. Indeed, the elephants came as was expected,
drank, and then duly fell down intoxicated. The carpenters cut off the
innumerable tusks, took them to the chosen place, and began building,
and in seven days the castle was ready. When the king saw this, he was
again amazed, and said to his prime minister: &ldquo;Now what shall I
do with him? He is not an ordinary youth! God alone knows who he
is!&rdquo; Thereupon the officer answered: &ldquo;Give him one more
order, and if he executes it successfully, he will prove that he is a
supernatural being.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5041" class="main">The Third Task</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus he again advised the king, who called the youth
and said to him: &ldquo;I command you to go and bring me the princess
of a certain kingdom, who is living in such and such a castle. If you
do not bring her to me, you will surely lose your life!&rdquo; When the
youth heard this, he went straight to his mother and told her of this
new task; whereupon the mother advised him to seek his girl friend once
more. He hurried to where beyond the village he had met the girl
before, and as he came to the spot she reappeared. She listened
intently to the youth&rsquo;s account of his last visit to the court,
and then said: &ldquo;Go and ask the king to give you a galley; in the
galley there must be made twenty shops with different merchandise in
each; in each shop there must, also, be a handsome youth to sell the
wares. On your voyage you will meet a man who carries an eagle; you
must buy his eagle and pay for it whatever price he may ask. Then you
will meet a second man, in a boat carrying in his net a carp with
golden scales; you must buy the carp at any cost. The third man whom
you will meet, will be carrying a dove, which you must also buy. Then
you must take a feather from the eagle&rsquo;s tail, a scale from the
carp, and a feather from the left wing of the dove, and give the
creatures their freedom.<a id="xd19e5045" name="xd19e5045"></a> When
you reach that distant kingdom and are near the castle in which the
princess resides, you must open all shops and order each youth to stand
at his door. And the girls who come down to the shore to fetch water
are sure to say that no one ever saw a ship loaded with such wonderful
and beautiful things in their town before; and then they will go and
spread the news all over the place. The news will reach the ears of the
princess, who will at once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=
"#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>ask her father&rsquo;s permission
to go and visit the galley. When she comes on board with her
ladies-in-waiting, you must lead the party from one shop to another,
and bring out and exhibit before her all the finest merchandise you
have; thus divert her and keep her on board your galley until evening,
then you must suddenly set sail; for by that time it will be so dark
that your departure will be unnoticed. The princess will have a
favourite bird on her shoulder, and, when she perceives that the galley
is sailing off, she will turn the bird loose and it will fly to the
palace with a message to her father of what has befallen her. When you
see that the bird has flown you must burn the eagle&rsquo;s feather;
the eagle will appear, and, when you command it to catch the bird, it
will instantly do so. Next, the princess will throw a pebble into the
sea, and the galley will immediately be still. Upon this you must burn
the scale of the carp at once; the carp will come to you and you must
instruct it to find the pebble and swallow it. As soon as this is done,
the galley will sail on again. Then you will proceed in peace for a
while; but, when you reach a certain spot between two mountains, your
galley will be suddenly petrified and you will be greatly alarmed. The
princess will then order you to bring her some water of life, whereupon
you must burn the feather of the dove, and when the bird appears you
must give it a small flask in which it will bring you the elixir, after
which your galley will sail on again and you will arrive home with the
princess without further adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth returned to his mother and she advised him to do as the
girl counselled him. So he went to the king and asked for all that was
necessary for his undertaking, and the king again gave him all he asked
for.</p>
<p>On his voyage everything was accomplished as the girl <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>had
foretold, and he succeeded in bringing home the princess in triumph.
The king and his prime minister from the balcony of the palace saw the
galley returning, and the prime minister said: &ldquo;Now you really
must have him killed as soon as he lands; otherwise you will never be
able to get rid of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the galley reached the port, the princess first came ashore
with her ladies-in-waiting; then the handsome young men who had sold
the wares, and finally the youth himself. The king had ordered an
executioner to be in readiness, and as soon as the youth stepped on
shore he was seized by the king&rsquo;s servants and his head was
chopped off.</p>
<p>It was the king&rsquo;s intention to espouse the beautiful princess,
and, as soon as he saw her, he approached her with compliments and
flattery. But the princess would not listen to his honeyed words; she
turned away and asked: &ldquo;Where is my captor, who did so much for
me?&rdquo; And, when she saw that his head had been cut off, she
immediately took the small flask and poured some of its contents over
the body and, lo! the youth arose in perfect health. When the king and
his minister saw this marvellous thing, the latter said: &ldquo;This
young man must now be wiser than ever, for was he not dead, and has he
not returned to life?&rdquo; Whereupon the king, desirous of knowing if
it were true that one who has been dead knows all things when he
returns to life, ordered the executioner to chop off his head, that the
princess might bring him to life again by the power of her wonderful
water of life.</p>
<p>But, when the king&rsquo;s head was off, the princess would not hear
of restoring him to life, but immediately wrote to her father, telling
him of her love for the youth and declaring her wish to marry him, and
described to her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220"
name="pb220">220</a>]</span>father all that had happened. Her father
replied, saying that he approved of his daughter&rsquo;s choice, and he
issued a proclamation which stated that, unless the people would elect
the youth to be their ruler, he would declare war against them. The men
of that country immediately recognized that this would be only just,
and so the youth became king, wedded the fair princess, and gave large
estates and titles to all the handsome youths who had helped him on his
expedition.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived a tsar, who had three
sons and one daughter. The latter was kept in a cage by her father, for
he loved her as he loved his own eyes. When the girl grew up she begged
her father&rsquo;s permission to go out one evening with her brothers,
and the tsar granted her wish. No sooner had she left the palace than a
dragon flew down, seized the princess and, despite her brothers,
disappeared with her into the clouds. The princes hastened to tell
their father what had happened, and they implored him to let them go in
search of their sister.</p>
<p>Thereupon their unhappy father gave each of them a horse and other
necessary equipment for a long journey, and they started out upon their
quest. After journeying a long way, they sighted in the distance a
pavilion, which was neither in the sky nor on the earth, but was
hanging midway between. When they came underneath this, it occurred to
them that their sister might be hidden in it, and they began to
consider how best they might reach it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>Finally they decided
that one of them must kill his horse, cut its hide into strips, make a
thong, and, fastening one end to an arrow, shoot it from the bow so
strongly that it should strike deeply into the framework of the
pavilion, thus making a way up which they could climb.</p>
<p>The two younger brothers proposed to the eldest that he should kill
his horse, but he refused. Neither would the second brother consent to
do so; then the youngest brother, seeing that it could not be helped,
killed his horse, made its hide into a lengthy thong, fixed one end to
his arrow, and shot straight up to the pavilion, where the arrow stuck
firmly.</p>
<p>Next they had to discuss who should climb up the thong; again the
two elder brothers refused, so it fell to the youngest to perform this
exploit. Being very agile, he soon reached the pavilion; wandering from
one room to another, he finally came to an apartment where, to his
great joy, he saw his sister sitting with the sleeping dragon&rsquo;s
head on her knee. When the princess beheld her brother, she feared
exceedingly for his life, and implored him to escape before the dragon
awoke.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The courageous youth, however, would not obey his
sister, but seized his mace and struck the dragon on the head. The
monster pointed with one of his claws to the place where he had been
struck and said to the maiden: &ldquo;Something bit me here!&rdquo;
Again the prince raised his mace and delivered a blow upon the
monster&rsquo;s head; but the dragon apparently did not mind, for he
pointed again indifferently to the place, saying: &ldquo;Again
something has bitten me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young prince was on the point of striking the third <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>time, when his sister pointed to a spot where
only the dragon might receive a mortal wound, and directing his blow
upon the place indicated, the dragon instantly succumbed. The princess
at once freed herself of the dragon&rsquo;s head, ran swiftly to kiss
her brother, and then was eager to show him the different rooms.</p>
<p>First, she took him into a room in which stood a black steed
fastened to a stall and decked with a saddle and harness adorned with
pure silver. Next she led him into a second room, where they found a
white horse, also ready to be mounted, but its harness was of pure
gold. Then she took him into a third room, where was a beautiful Arab
steed whose saddle, stirrups and bridle were studded with precious
stones.</p>
<p>The princess next conducted her brother to a chamber in which a
maiden was sitting at a golden tambourette engaged in embroidering with
golden threads. From thence she led him into a second apartment where a
girl was spinning gold threads. At last they entered a third room in
which a maiden sat threading pearls, and before her, upon a golden
plate, was a golden hen with its chickens, sorting the pearls.</p>
<p>Having satisfied his curiosity, the prince returned to the room
where he had left the dead dragon, and threw the carcass down to earth;
and at the mere sight of the dragon&rsquo;s body the two brothers were
terrified out of their wits. Next the prince slowly let down his
sister, and, after her, the three maidens, together with their work.
While he was thus engaged he shouted to his brothers and made gestures
indicating to whom each of the girls should belong. He reserved for
himself the one who had been threading pearls, not forgetting the
golden hen and the chickens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=

<h4 id="xd19e5101" class="main">The Perfidy of the Brothers</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">His brothers, envying the heroism of the young prince
and jealous of his successful exploits, were now guilty of a dastardly
trick; they cut the thong in order that he might not be able to reach
the earth, and taking their sister with all the booty they hurriedly
decamped.</p>
<p>On the way home the princes met a shepherd watching his sheep, and
they prevailed upon him to disguise himself and to impersonate their
youngest brother, ordering their sister and the three maidens to keep
strictly their secret.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed, and one day the youngest prince had tidings that
his brothers and the disguised shepherd were on the point of marrying
the three maidens. This information seems to have been singularly
complete, for on the day of his eldest brother&rsquo;s wedding, mounted
on the black steed, he flew down and alighted in front of the church.
There he awaited the moment for the procession to come out, and, as his
brother was preparing to mount his horse, he approached him swiftly,
raised his club and struck him a heavy blow so that he fell instantly.
The young prince then remounted the black horse and was instantly
transported to the mysterious pavilion.</p>
<p>On the wedding-day of his second brother the feat, this time on the
white horse, was repeated, none guessing who the strange aggressor
was.</p>
<p>Next came the turn of the shepherd. On the day of his wedding with
the third maiden, the young prince, mounted on the Arab, alighted in
the churchyard just at the moment when the wedding procession started
to return. This time he struck the bridegroom on the head so heavily
that he fell dead. The guests hurriedly alighted from their horses and
surrounded the prince, who made no attempt to escape, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>but
revealed himself as the third son of their tsar. He told them that the
pretended prince, whom he had just sent to the other world, was but a
common shepherd, and that his brothers, out of envy, had caused him to
remain in the magic pavilion where he had discovered his sister and
killed the dragon. All that he said was immediately confirmed by his
sister and the three maidens. When the tsar heard this he was very
angry with his two elder sons, and drove them for ever from his palace.
But as for his valiant youngest son, he united him to the third maiden
and left him the crown and all he possessed when he died.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5116" class="main">III. Pepelyouga</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On a high pasture land, near by an immense precipice,
some maidens were occupied in spinning and attending to their grazing
cattle, when an old strange-looking man with a white beard reaching
down to his girdle approached, and said: &ldquo;O fair maidens, beware
of the abyss, for if one of you should drop her spindle down the cliff,
her mother would be turned into a cow that very moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying the aged man disappeared, and the girls, bewildered by his
words, and discussing the strange incident, approached near to the
ravine which had suddenly become interesting to them. They peered
curiously over the edge, as though expecting to see some unaccustomed
sight, when suddenly the most beautiful of the maidens let her spindle
drop from her hand, and ere she could recover it, it was bounding from
rock to rock into the depths beneath. When she returned home that
evening she found her worst fears realized, for her mother stood before
the door transformed into a cow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"
href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>A short time later her father married again. His new wife was a
widow, and brought a daughter of her own into her new home. This girl
was not particularly well-favoured, and her mother immediately began to
hate her stepdaughter because of the latter&rsquo;s good looks. She
forebade her henceforth to wash her face, to comb her hair or to change
her clothes, and in every way she could think of she sought to make her
miserable.</p>
<p>One morning she gave her a bag filled with hemp, saying: &ldquo;If
you do not spin this and make a fine top of it by to-night, you need
not return home, for I intend to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor girl, deeply dejected, walked behind the cattle,
industriously spinning as she went, but by noon when the cattle lay
down in the shade to rest, she observed that she had made but little
progress and she began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p>Now, her mother was driven daily to pasture with the other cows, and
seeing her daughter&rsquo;s tears she drew near and asked why she wept,
whereupon the maiden told her all. Then the cow comforted her daughter,
saying: &ldquo;My darling child, be consoled! Let me take the hemp into
my mouth and chew it; through my ear a thread will come out. You must
take the end of this and wind it into a top.&rdquo; So this was done;
the hemp was soon spun, and when the girl gave it to her stepmother
that evening, she was greatly surprised.</p>
<p>Next morning the woman roughly ordered the maiden to spin a still
larger bag of hemp, and as the girl, thanks to her mother, spun and
wound it all her stepmother, on the following day, gave her twice the
quantity to spin. Nevertheless, the girl brought home at night even
that unusually large quantity well spun, and her stepmother
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>concluded that the poor girl was not spinning
alone, but that other maidens, her friends, were giving her help.
Therefore she, next morning, sent her own daughter to spy upon the poor
girl and to report what she saw. The girl soon noticed that the cow
helped the poor orphan by chewing the hemp, while she drew the thread
and wound it on a top, and she ran back home and informed her mother of
what she had seen. Upon this, the stepmother insisted that her husband
should order that particular cow to be slaughtered. Her husband at
first hesitated, but as his wife urged him more and more, he finally
decided to do as she wished.</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5135">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5136" class="main">The Promise</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On learning what had been decided, the stepdaughter
wept more than ever, and when her mother asked what was the matter, she
told her tearfully all that had been arranged. Thereupon the cow said
to her daughter: &ldquo;Wipe away your tears, and do not cry any more.
When they slaughter me, you must take great care not to eat any of the
meat, but after the repast, carefully collect my bones and inter them
behind the house under a certain stone; then, should you ever be in
need of help, come to my grave and there you will find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cow was killed, and when the meat was served the poor girl
declined to eat of it, pretending that she had no appetite; after the
meal she gathered with great care all the bones and buried them on the
spot indicated by her mother.</p>
<p>Now, the name of the maiden was &lsquo;Marra,&rsquo; but, as she had
to do the roughest work of the house, such as carrying water, washing
and sweeping, she was called by her stepmother and stepsister
&lsquo;Pepelyouga&rsquo; (Cinderella). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>One Sunday, when the
stepmother and her daughter had dressed themselves for church, the
woman spread about the house the contents of a basketful of millet, and
said: &ldquo;Listen, Pepelyouga; if you do not gather up all this
millet and have dinner ready by the time we return from church, I will
kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had gone, the poor girl began to weep, reflecting,
&ldquo;As to the dinner I can easily prepare it, but how can I possibly
gather up all this millet?&rdquo; But that very moment she recalled the
words of the cow, that, if she ever should be struck by misfortune, she
need but walk to the grave behind the house, when she would find
instant help there. Immediately she ran out, and, when she approached
the grave, lo! a chest was lying on the grave wide open, and inside
were beautiful dresses and everything necessary for a lady&rsquo;s
toilet. Two doves were sitting on the lid of the chest, and as the girl
drew near, they said to her: &ldquo;Marra, take from the chest the
dress you like the best, clothe yourself and go to church; as to the
millet and other work, we ourselves will attend to that and see that
everything is in good order!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5148">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5149" class="main">Marra goes to Church</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marra needed no second invitation; she took the first
silk dress she touched, made her toilet and went to church, where her
entrance created quite a sensation. Everybody, men and women, greatly
admired her beauty and her costly attire, but they were puzzled as to
who she was, and whence she came. A prince happened to be in the church
on that day, and he, too, admired the beautiful maiden.</p>
<p>Just before the service ended, the girl stole from the church, went
hurriedly home, took off her beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>clothes and placed
them back in the chest, which instantly shut and became invisible. She
then rushed to the kitchen, where she discovered that the dinner was
quite ready, and that the millet was gathered into the basket. Soon the
stepmother came back with her daughter and they were astounded to find
the millet gathered up, dinner prepared, and everything else in order.
A desire to learn the secret now began to torment the stepmother
mightily.</p>
<p>Next Sunday everything happened as before, except that the girl
found in the chest a silver dress, and that the prince felt a greater
admiration for her, so much so that he was unable, even for a moment,
to take his eyes from her.</p>
<p>On the third Sunday, the mother and daughter again prepared to go to
church, and, having scattered the millet as before, she repeated her
previous threats. As soon as they disappeared, the girl ran straight to
her mother&rsquo;s grave, where she found, as on the previous
occasions, the open chest and the same two doves. This time she found a
dress made of gold lace, and she hastily clad herself in it and went to
church, where she was admired by all, even more than before. As for the
tsar&rsquo;s son, he had come with the intention not to let her this
time out of his sight, but to follow and see whither she went.
Accordingly, as the service drew near to its close, and the maiden
withdrew quietly as before, the enamoured prince followed after her.
Marra hurried along, for she had none too much time, and, as she went,
one of her golden slippers came off, and she was too agitated to stop
and pick it up. The prince, however, who had lost sight of the maiden,
saw the slipper and put it in his pocket. Reaching home, Marra took off
her golden dress, laid it in the chest, and rushed back to the
house.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5169" class="main">The Prince&rsquo;s Quest</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prince now resolved to go from house to house
throughout his father&rsquo;s realm in search of the owner of the
slipper, inviting all fair maidens to try on the golden slipper. But,
alas! his efforts seemed to be doomed to failure; for some girls the
slipper was too long, for others too short, for others, again, too
narrow. There was no one whom it would fit.</p>
<p>Wandering from door to door, the sad prince at length came to the
house of Marra&rsquo;s father. The stepmother was expecting him, and
she had hidden her stepdaughter under a large trough in the courtyard.
When the prince asked whether she had any daughters, the stepmother
answered that she had but one, and she presented the girl to him. The
prince requested the girl to try on the slipper, but, squeeze as she
would, there was not room in it even for her toes! Thereupon the prince
asked whether it was true that there were no other girls in the house,
and the stepmother replied that indeed it was quite true.</p>
<p>That very moment a cock flew on to the trough and crowed out
lustily: &ldquo;<i>Kook-oo-ryeh-koooo!</i> Here she is under this very
trough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stepmother, enraged, exclaimed: &ldquo;Sh&mdash;&mdash;! Go
away! May an eagle seize you and fly off with you!&rdquo; The curiosity
of the prince was aroused; he approached the trough, lifted it up, and,
to his great surprise, there was the maiden whom he had seen thrice in
church, clad in the very same golden dress she had last worn, and
having only one golden slipper.</p>
<p>When the prince recognized the maiden he was overcome with joy.
Quickly he tried the slipper on her dainty foot; it not only fitted her
admirably, but it exactly matched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>the one she already wore on
her left foot. He lifted her up tenderly and escorted her to his
palace. Later he won her love, and they were happily married.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5187" class="main">IV. Animals&rsquo; Language</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The universality of folk-lore is curiously illustrated
in the following tale which is strikingly like a story native to the
negroes of Western Africa. In this the hero is granted, as a boon by
the King of the Animals, the gift of understanding animal language; he
is warned that if he divulges to any that he possesses this gift he
will die on the instant; he is made rich by the possession of it; he
laughs at a conversation between animals which he overhears; his wife
demands to know the cause of his laughter. To this point the two
stories are identical, but in the West African tale the man divulges
the secret and pays the penalty with his life, whereas the Serbian
conclusion is very much less tame, as will be seen.</p>
<p>A wealthy peasant had a shepherd, who served him for a great number
of years most honestly and faithfully. One day, as he drove his sheep
through a forest to the pasture, he heard a hissing sound, and wondered
what it could be. Listening carefully he went nearer and nearer to the
spot whence the sound came, and he saw that the forest was on fire and
that the hissing proceeded from a snake that was surrounded by flames.
The shepherd watched to see what the poor creature would do in its
trouble: and when the snake saw the shepherd, it exclaimed from the
midst of the flames: &ldquo;O shepherd, I pray of you, save me from
this fire!&rdquo; Then the shepherd reached out his crook and the snake
entwined itself swiftly round the stick, round his arm, on to his
shoulders and round his neck.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5194width" id="p232"><img src="images/p232.jpg"
alt="The snake entwined itself swiftly round his arm" width="491"

<p class="figureHead">The snake entwined itself swiftly round his
arm</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the shepherd realized what was happening he was seized with
horror, and cried out: &ldquo;What are you about to do, ungrateful
creature! Did I save your life only to lose my own?&rdquo; And the
snake answered him: &ldquo;Have no fear, my saviour! But take me to my
father&rsquo;s house! My father is the king of the
snake-world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd endeavoured to move the snake to pity and prayed it to
excuse him, for he could not leave his sheep. Thereupon the snake said
to him: &ldquo;Be comforted, my friend! Do not trouble about your
sheep; nothing amiss will happen to them, but now do hasten to my
father&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; So the shepherd went with the snake round
his neck through the forest, till he came at length to a doorway
constructed entirely of serpents. When they came near the gate, the
shepherd&rsquo;s guide hissed to its servants, whereupon all the snakes
instantly untwined themselves, leaving a way open for the shepherd, who
passed through unmolested. Then the snake said to its preserver:
&ldquo;When we come before my father he will surely give you, as reward
for your kindness to me, whatever you may wish: gold, silver and
precious stones; but you should not accept anything of that kind. I
would advise you to ask for the language of animals. He will
undoubtedly be opposed to your wish, but finally he will
yield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They now entered the apartments of the king, who, with evident
relief, inquired: &ldquo;My son, where have you been all this
time?&rdquo; The reptile then told all about the fire in the forest and
of the kindness of the shepherd, who had saved his life. At this the
snake-king turned with emotion to the shepherd: &ldquo;What reward can
I give you for having saved the life of my son?&rdquo; he said. The
shepherd answered: &ldquo;I desire nothing but the power of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>understanding and speaking the language of
animals.&rdquo; But the monarch said: &ldquo;That is not for you, for
if I give you that power, and you should impart the secret to another,
you will instantly die. Therefore choose some other gift.&rdquo; But
the shepherd insisted: &ldquo;If you wish to reward me, give me the
language of animals: if you do not care to gratify my wish, no more
need be said; I bid you farewell!&rdquo; And indeed he turned to go,
but the king, seeing his determination, stopped him, exclaiming:
&ldquo;Come here, my friend! Since you so strongly desire the language
of animals, the gift shall not be withheld; open your mouth!&rdquo; The
shepherd obeyed, and the snake-king blew into his mouth, and said:
&ldquo;Now, blow into my mouth!&rdquo; The shepherd did as he was told,
and the snake-king blew a second time in the shepherd&rsquo;s mouth,
and then said: &ldquo;Now you have the language of animals. Go in
peace; but be sure not to impart your secret to another, else you will
die that very moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd took leave of his friends and as he returned through
the woods he heard and understood everything the birds, plants and
other living creatures were saying to each other. When he reached his
flock and found all his sheep safe as had been promised, he lay on the
grass to rest.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5210" class="main">The Buried Treasure</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hardly had he settled himself, than two ravens
alighted on a tree near by and began to converse: &ldquo;If this
shepherd knew what is under the spot where that black lamb is lying, he
would surely dig in the earth; he would discover a cave full of silver
and gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd at once went to his master and told him of the buried
treasure. The latter drove a cart to the place <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>indicated, dug deeply in the earth and lo! he
found a cave full of silver and gold, the contents of which he placed
in his cart and carried home. This master was an honest and generous
man, and he gave the entire treasure to his shepherd, saying:
&ldquo;Take this, my son; it was to you that God gave it! I would
advise you to build a house, to marry and start some good business with
this gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd did as his kindly master advised him, and, little by
little he multiplied his wealth and became the richest man, not only in
his village, but in the whole district. He now hired his own shepherds,
cattle-drivers and swineherds to keep his great property in good order.
One day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife: &ldquo;Prepare
wine and food, for to-morrow we will go to our farms and feast our
servants.&rdquo; His wife did as he bade, and the next morning they
went to their farms, and the master said to his men: &ldquo;Now come
one and all, eat and drink together; as for the sheep I will myself
watch them to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the kind man went to guard his sheep. About midnight, wolves
began to howl and his dogs barked a defiance. Said the wolves in their
own language to the dogs: &ldquo;Can we come and kill the sheep? There
will be enough for you also.&rdquo; Thereupon the dogs answered in
their own tongue: &ldquo;O come by all means, we also would like to
have a feast!&rdquo; But amongst the dogs there was a very old one who
had only two teeth left. That faithful animal barked furiously at the
wolves: &ldquo;To the devil with you all! So long as I have these two
teeth, you shall not touch my master&rsquo;s sheep!&rdquo; And the
master heard and understood every word they uttered. Next morning he
ordered his servants to kill all his dogs, except the old one. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>servants began to implore their master, saying:
&ldquo;Dear master, it is a pity to kill them!&rdquo; But the master
would not suffer any remonstrance, and sternly ordered: &ldquo;Do as I
bid you!&rdquo; Then he and his wife mounted their horses and started
for home, he on a horse and she on a mare. As they journeyed, the horse
left the mare a little behind and he neighed, saying: &ldquo;Hurry up,
why do you dawdle behind?&rdquo; And the mare answered: &ldquo;Eh, it
is not hard for you&mdash;you are carrying only your master, and I am
carrying a despotic woman whose rules are a burden to the whole
household.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5225" class="main">The Importunate Wife</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hearing this, the master turned his head and burst
into laughter. His wife noticing his sudden mirth, spurred on her mare,
and when she reached her husband she asked him why he had laughed. He
answered: &ldquo;There is no reason, I just laughed.&rdquo; But the
woman was not satisfied with this reply and would not give her husband
any peace. He endeavoured in vain to excuse himself, saying:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep on asking me; if I tell you the true reason why
I laughed, I shall instantly die!&rdquo; But she did not believe her
husband, and the more he refused to tell her, the more she insisted
that he should do so, until at last the poor man was worn out by her
persistence.</p>
<p>Directly they arrived home, therefore, the man ordered a coffin to
be made, and, when it was ready and he had it placed in front of the
house-door, he said to his wife: &ldquo;I shall lie down in this
coffin, for the moment I tell you why I laughed, I shall die.&rdquo; So
he laid himself in the coffin, and as he took a last look around, he
saw his faithful old dog, coming from the fields. The poor animal
approached his master&rsquo;s coffin and sat near his head howling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>with grief. When the master saw this, he
requested his wife to give it food. The woman brought bread and gave it
to the dog, who would not even look at it, still less eat it. The piece
of bread attracted a cock, which came forward and began to peck at it;
the dog reproached him saying: &ldquo;You insatiable creature! You
think of nothing but food, and you fail to see that our dear master is
about to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this reprimand the cock retorted: &ldquo;Let him die, since he is
such a foolish man! I have a hundred wives, and I gather them all round
a grain of corn, which I happen to find; and then, when they have all
assembled, I swallow it myself! If any of them should protest, I just
peck at them; but he, the fool, is not able to rule a single
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the man jumped out of the coffin, took a stick and called to
his wife: &ldquo;Come in the house, wife, and I shall tell you why I
laughed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the obvious intention of her husband, the woman begged him to
desist, and promised that nevermore would she be curious, or try to pry
into his affairs.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5240" class="main">V. The Stepmother and her
Stepdaughter</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a girl who lived with her
stepmother. The woman hated her stepdaughter exceedingly, because she
was more beautiful than her own daughter, whom she had brought with her
to the house. She did her utmost to turn the poor girl&rsquo;s own
father against her, and with such success that he soon began to scold
and even to hate his own child.</p>
<p>One day the woman said to her husband: &ldquo;We must send your
daughter away. She must go into the world to seek her fortune!&rdquo;
And he answered: &ldquo;How can we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>send the poor girl away?
Where could she go alone?&rdquo; But the wicked stepmother replied:
&ldquo;To-morrow you must take her far into the woods, leave her there
and hurry home, or I will no longer live with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate father at length gave way, and said: &ldquo;At least
prepare the girl something for her journey, that she may not die of
hunger.&rdquo; The stepmother therefore made a cake, and gave it to the
girl next morning as she was leaving the house. The man and his
daughter trudged on until they were right in the depth of the woods,
and then the father stole away and returned home.</p>
<p>The girl, alone in the woods, wandered all the rest of that day in
search of a path, but could not find one. Meanwhile it grew darker and
darker, and at length she climbed a tree, fearing lest some wild beast
should devour her if she remained through the night on the ground. And
indeed, all night long the wolves howled under the tree so ravenously
that the poor girl, in her nervous terror, could hardly keep from
falling.</p>
<p>Next morning she descended the tree and wandered on again in search
of some way out, but the more she walked the denser grew the forest,
and there seemed to be no end to it. When it grew dark again, she
looked about for another suitable tree in the branches of which she
might safely pass the night, but suddenly she noticed something shining
through the darkness. She thought it might, perhaps, be a dwelling, and
she went toward it. And indeed, she came soon to a large fine house,
the doors of which were open. She entered, and saw many elegant rooms,
in one of which was a large table with lights burning on it. She
thought this must be the dwelling of brigands, but she had no fear at
all, for she reasoned with herself: &ldquo;Only rich people need fear
robbers; I, a poor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237"
name="pb237">237</a>]</span>simple girl, have nothing to be afraid of;
I shall tell them that I am ready to work for them gladly if they will
give me something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5257" class="main">A Strange Dwelling</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then she took the cake from her bag, made the sign of
the cross<a class="noteref" id="xd19e5261src" href="#xd19e5261" name=
"xd19e5261src">2</a> and began her meal. No sooner had she begun to eat
than a cock appeared and flew near her as if begging for a share. The
good girl crumbled a piece of her cake and fed him. Shortly afterward a
little dog came and began in his own way to express friendly feeling
toward her. The girl broke another piece of her cake, gently took the
little dog in her lap, and began feeding and caressing it. After that a
cat came in too, and she did the same with her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a loud growling, and she was terrified to see a
lion coming toward her. The great beast waved his tail in such a
friendly manner, and looked so very kind, however, that her courage
revived, and she gave him a piece of her cake, which the lion ate; and
then he began to lick her hand. This proof of gratitude reassured the
girl completely, and she stroked the lion gently, and gave him more of
the cake.</p>
<p>All at once the girl heard a great clashing of weapons, and nearly
swooned as a creature in a bear-skin entered the room. The cock, the
dog, the cat and the lion all ran to meet it, and frisked about it
affectionately, showing many signs of pleasure and rejoicing. She, poor
creature, did not think this strange being could be anything but cruel,
and expected it would spring upon her and devour her. But the seeming
monster threw the bear-skin from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"
href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>its head and shoulders, and
at once the whole room gleamed with the magnificence of its golden
garments. The girl almost lost her senses when she saw before her a
handsome man of noble appearance. He approached her and said: &ldquo;Do
not fear! I am not a lawless man, I am the tsar&rsquo;s son; and when I
wish to hunt, I usually come here, disguised in this bear-skin, lest
the people should recognize me. Save you, no one knows that I am a man;
people think I am an apparition, and flee from me. No one dares to pass
near this house, still less to enter it, for it is known that I dwell
in it. You are the first who has ventured to come in; probably you knew
that I was not a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the girl told the prince all about her wicked stepmother,
and declared that she knew nothing of this dwelling or who lived in it.
When the young prince heard her story, moved with indignation and pity,
he said: &ldquo;Your stepmother hated you, but God loved you. I love
you very much, too, and if you feel you could return my love, I would
like to marry you&mdash;will you be my wife?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
replied the maiden.</p>
<p>Next morning the prince took the girl to his father&rsquo;s palace
and they were married. After some time the prince&rsquo;s bride begged
to be allowed to go and pay a visit to her father. The prince gladly
allowed her to do as she wished, and donning a fine robe embroidered
with gold she went to her old home. Her father happened to be absent,
and her stepmother, seeing her coming, feared that she had come to
revenge herself; therefore she hurried out to meet her, saying:
&ldquo;You see now that I sent you on the road of happiness?&rdquo; The
stepdaughter embraced the woman and kissed her; she also embraced her
stepsister. Then she sat down to await her father&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>return, but at length, as he did not come, she
was compelled reluctantly to leave without seeing him. On going away
she gave much money to her stepmother, nevertheless when she had got
some distance from the house, the ungrateful woman steathily shook her
fist at her, muttering: &ldquo;Wait a little, you accursed creature,
you shall certainly not be the only one so elegantly dressed; to-morrow
I shall send my own daughter the same way!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5277" class="main">The Envy of the Stepmother</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The husband did not return until late in the evening,
when his wife met him, saying: &ldquo;Listen, husband! I propose that
my own daughter should be sent out into the world that she may also
seek her fortune; for your girl came back to visit us to-day and lo!
she was glittering in gold.&rdquo; The man sighed and agreed.</p>
<p>Next morning the woman prepared for her daughter several cakes and
some roast meat and sent her with the father into the forest. The
unfortunate man guided her as he had led his own daughter, into the
heart of the forest, and then stole off leaving her alone. When the
girl saw that her father had disappeared she walked on slowly through
the woods, till she came to the gates of the same house in which her
stepsister had found happiness. She entered, closed the door and
resolved not to open it for anybody. Then she took a cake out of her
bag and began her meal. Meanwhile the cock, the dog and the cat came
in, and began to frisk about her playfully expecting that she would
give them something to eat, but she exclaimed angrily: &ldquo;Get away,
you ugly creatures! I have hardly enough for myself; I will not give
you any!&rdquo; Then she began to beat them; whereat the dog howled,
and the lion, hearing his friend&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>lamentation, rushed
in furiously and killed the unkind girl.</p>
<p>Next morning the prince rode out with his wife to hunt. They came to
the house, and saw what had happened, and when the princess recognized
her stepsister&rsquo;s dress, she gathered up the torn garment and
carried it to her father&rsquo;s house. This time she found her father
at home, and he was indeed very happy to learn that his dear daughter
was married to a handsome prince. When, however, he heard what had
befallen his wife&rsquo;s daughter he was sad indeed, and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Her mother has deserved this punishment from the hand of God,
because she hated you without reason. She is at the well, I will go and
tell her the sad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his wife heard what had happened, she said: &ldquo;O husband! I
cannot bear the sight of your daughter; let us kill both her and the
tsar&rsquo;s son! Do this thing or I will jump at once into the
well.&rdquo; The man indignantly answered: &ldquo;Well then, jump! I
shall not murder my own child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the wicked woman said: &ldquo;If you cannot kill her, I cannot
bear to look at her!&rdquo; Thereupon she jumped into the well and was
killed.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5292" class="main">VI. Justice and Injustice</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a king who had two sons, one of whom was
cunning and unjust, and the other good and just. In due time the king
died, and the unjust son said to his brother: &ldquo;As you are younger
than I, you cannot expect me to share the throne with you, so you had
better go away from the palace. Take these three hundred
<i>tzechins</i><a class="noteref" id="xd19e5298src" href="#xd19e5298"
name="xd19e5298src">3</a> and a horse to ride: this is to be your share
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>the inheritance.&rdquo; The younger brother took
the gold and his horse, and reflecting he said: &ldquo;God be praised!
How much of the entire kingdom has fallen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time later the two brothers met by chance on a road, and the
younger saluted the elder thus: &ldquo;God help you, brother!&rdquo;
And the elder answered: &ldquo;May God send you a misfortune! Why do
you for ever mention the name of God to me? Injustice is better than
justice.&rdquo; Thereupon the good brother said: &ldquo;I wager that
injustice is not better than justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they laid as a wager one hundred <i>tzechins</i> and agreed to
accept the decision of the first passer-by whom they should happen to
meet. Riding on a little farther they met Satan, who had disguised
himself as a monk, and they requested him to decide their contest.
Satan immediately answered that injustice is better than justice; so
the just brother lost one hundred <i>tzechins</i>. Then they made
another wager in the same sum, and again a third; and each time the
Devil&mdash;differently disguised on each occasion&mdash;pronounced for
injustice. Finally the good brother lost even his horse; but he was
quite unconvinced and he reflected: &ldquo;Ah, well! I have lost all my
<i>tzechins</i><span class="corr" id="xd19e5317" title=
"Source: .">,</span> it is true, but I have still my eyes, and I shall
wager my eyes this time.&rdquo; So they made the bet once more, but the
unjust brother did not even wait anybody&rsquo;s arbitration, he took
out his poniard and pierced his brother&rsquo;s eyes, saying:
&ldquo;Now, let justice help you, when you have no eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor youth said to his cruel brother: &ldquo;I have lost my eyes
for the sake of God&rsquo;s justice, but I pray you, my brother, give
me a little water in a vessel that I may wash my wounds and take me
under the pine-tree, near the spring!&rdquo; The unjust brother did as
he was asked and then departed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"

the night, when some veele came to the spring to bathe, and he heard
one of them say to her sisters: &ldquo;Do you know, O sisters, that the
royal princess suffers from leprosy, and the king, her father, has
consulted all the famous physicians, but no one can cure her? But if
the king knew the healing qualities of this water, he would surely take
a little and bathe his daughter with it, and she would recover perfect
health.&rdquo; When the cocks began to crow, the veele disappeared and
the prince crept to the spring to test its wonderful properties. He
bathed his eyes, and lo! his sight was instantly restored; then he
filled his vessel with the water, and hurried to the king, whose
daughter was suffering from leprosy. Arriving at the palace he told the
officers on guard that he could cure the princess in a day and a night.
The officers informed the king, who at once allowed him to try his
method and the suffering princess was restored. This pleased the king
so much that he gave the young prince half of his kingdom, as well as
his daughter for his wife. So the just brother became the king&rsquo;s
son-in-law, and a Councillor of State.</p>

<p>The tidings of this great event spread all over the kingdom, and
finally came to the ears of the unjust prince. He thought that his
brother must have found his good fortune under the pine-tree, so he
went there himself to try his luck. Arrived there, he pierced his own
eyes. Late in the night, the veele came to bathe, and the prince heard
them discuss with astonishment the recovery of the royal princess.
&ldquo;Some one must have spied upon us,&rdquo; said one of them,
&ldquo;when we discussed about the qualities which this water
possesses; perhaps somebody is watching <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

immediately tore him into four.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5341" class="main">VII. He Who Asks Little Receives
Much</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived three brothers, who
instead of much property had only a pear-tree. Each would watch that
tree in turn, whilst the other two went away from home to work for
hire. One night God sent His angel to see how the brothers lived, and,
should they be in misery, to improve their position. The angel came
disguised as a beggar, and when he found one of the brothers watching
the tree, he went forward and asked him for a pear. The youth plucked
some of the fruit from his own part of the tree, handed them to the
beggar, and said: &ldquo;Accept these pears from my share of the tree,
but I cannot give you those belonging to my brothers.&rdquo; The angel
took the fruit, thanked the youth, and disappeared.</p>
<p>The next day it was the turn of the second brother to watch the
fruit, and the angel, again in the semblance of a beggar, came and
asked for a pear. This brother likewise gave from his own part of the
tree, saying: &ldquo;Take these, they are my own; but of those
belonging to my brothers I dare not offer you.&rdquo; The angel took
the fruit gratefully and departed.</p>
<p>The third brother had a similar experience.</p>
<p>When the fourth day came, the angel disguised himself as a monk, and
came very early so that he could find all three brothers at home, and
he said to the youths: &ldquo;Come with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>me, I shall improve
your state of life,&rdquo; whereupon they obeyed without question.</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at a river where the water was flowing in
torrents, and the angel asked the eldest brother: &ldquo;What would you
like to have?&rdquo; He answered: &ldquo;I should like all this water
to be changed into wine and to belong to me.&rdquo; The angel made the
sign of the cross with his stick, and lo! wine was flowing instead of
water, and that very moment there appeared on the banks of the
streamlet many barrels, and men filling them with wine; in one word,
there was a whole village. Then the angel turned again to the young man
and said: &ldquo;Here is what you wished; farewell!&rdquo; and he
continued his journey with the others.</p>
<p>The three went on till they came to a field where they saw numbers
of doves, and the angel asked the second brother: &ldquo;Now, what is
it that you would like?&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;I should like
all these doves to be changed into sheep, and to be mine!&rdquo; The
angel again made the sign of the cross in the air, and lo! sheep
instead of doves covered the field. Suddenly there appeared many
dairies; maidens were busy milking the sheep, others pouring out the
milk, others again making cream. There was also a slaughter-house, and
men busy, some cutting the meat into joints, others weighing it, others
again selling the meat and receiving the money for it. Then the angel
said: &ldquo;Here is all you wished for; farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angel now proceeded with the youngest brother, and having
crossed the field he asked him what he would like to have. The young
man answered: &ldquo;I should consider myself the happiest of men if
God were graciously pleased to grant me a wife of pure Christian
blood!&rdquo; Thereupon the angel replied: &ldquo;Oh, that is rather
difficult to find; in the whole world there are but three such women,
two of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>whom are married. The youngest is a maid, it is
true, but she is already sought in marriage by two wooers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Journeying on, they came to a city where a mighty tsar dwelt with
his daughter. She, indeed, was of pure Christian blood. The travellers
entered the palace and found two princes already there with their
wedding apples<a class="noteref" id="xd19e5363src" href="#xd19e5363"
name="xd19e5363src">4</a> laid upon a table. Then the young man also
placed his apple on the table. When the tsar saw the newcomers he said
to those around him: &ldquo;What shall we do now? Those are imperial
princes, and these men look like beggars!&rdquo; Thereupon the angel
said: &ldquo;Let the contest be decided thus: the princess shall plant
three vines in the garden, dedicating one to each of the three wooers;
and he on whose vine grapes are found next morning, is to be the one
whom the princess shall marry!&rdquo; This plan was agreed to by all,
and the princess accordingly planted three vines.</p>
<p>When the next morning dawned, lo! grapes hung in clusters on the
vine dedicated to the poor man. So the tsar could not refuse his
daughter to the youngest brother. After the marriage, the angel led the
young couple to the forest, where he left them for a full year.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then God sent again His angel, saying: &ldquo;Go down
to earth and see how those poor ones are living now: if they are in
misery, it may be you will be able to improve their condition!&rdquo;
The angel obeyed immediately, and disguising himself again as a beggar,
he went first to the eldest brother and asked him for a glass of wine.
But the rich man refused, saying: &ldquo;If I were to give every one a
glass of wine, there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>would be none left for myself!&rdquo; Upon
this the angel made the sign of the cross with his stick, and the
stream began instantly to flow with water as before. Then he turned to
the man and said: &ldquo;This was not for you; go back under the
pear-tree and continue to guard it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the angel went on to the second brother, whose fields were
covered with sheep, and asked him for a slice of cheese; but the rich
man refused, saying: &ldquo;If I were to give everybody a slice of
cheese, there would be none left for myself!&rdquo; Again the angel
made the sign of the cross with his stick, and lo! all the sheep turned
instantly into doves, who flew away. Then he said to the second
brother: &ldquo;Of a surety that was not for you, go under the
pear-tree and watch it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally the angel went to the youngest brother in order to see how
he was living, and found him with his wife in the forest, dwelling as a
poor man in a hut. He begged to be admitted into their hut, and to pass
the night there. They welcomed him very cordially, but they explained
that they could not entertain him as well as they would like to do.
&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; they added, &ldquo;very poor people.&rdquo; To
which the angel answered: &ldquo;Do not speak so, I shall be quite
content with what you have!&rdquo; They wondered then what to do, for
there was no corn in their hut to make real bread; they usually ground
the bark of certain trees and made bread from it. Such bread the wife
now made for their guest, and placed it in the oven to bake. When she
came later to inspect her baking, she was pleasantly surprised to find
a fine loaf of real bread.</p>
<p>When the couple saw this wonder they lifted their hands toward
heaven and gave thanks: &ldquo;We thank thee, O God! that we are now
able to entertain our guest!&rdquo; After they had placed the bread
before their guest, they brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>a vessel of water, and lo!
when they came to drink, they found it was wine.</p>
<p>Then the angel once more made the sign of the cross with his stick
over the hut, and on that spot instantly rose a beautiful palace,
containing an abundance of everything. Then the angel blessed the
couple and disappeared. The modest and pious man and woman lived there
happily ever after.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5391" class="main">VIII. Bash Tchelik or Real Steel</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived once a tsar who had three sons and three
daughters. When old age overtook him and the hour came for him to die
he called his children to him, and desired his sons to give their
sisters to the first wooers who might ask them in marriage. &ldquo;Do
as I tell you,&rdquo; added the dying tsar, &ldquo;or dread my
curse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after the tsar had passed away there came one night a
fearful knocking at the palace gate, so that the whole building shook,
and a great roaring, screaming, and blowing was heard; it seemed as if
the palace was assailed by some awful tempest. All the courtiers were
seized with unspeakable fear, and suddenly a voice from outside was
heard: &ldquo;O princes, open the door!&rdquo; Thereupon the eldest
brother exclaimed: &ldquo;Do not open!&rdquo; The second brother added:
&ldquo;Do not open for anything!&rdquo; But the youngest brother said:
&ldquo;I must open the door!&rdquo; and he sprang to the door and flung
it open. As he did so something came in, but the brothers could see
only a bright light, out of which proceeded these urgent words:
&ldquo;I have come to ask your eldest sister in marriage, and to take
her away this moment; for I have no time to lose, neither shall I come
a second time to demand her! Answer quickly, <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e5397" title="Source: Will">will</span> you give her or not? That
is what I must know.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>The eldest brother answered: &ldquo;I will not give her. I cannot
see you, and do not know who you are or even whence you came. To-night
is the first time I have heard your voice, and you insist upon taking
my sister away at once. Should I not know where I could visit my sister
sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second brother also said: &ldquo;I will not consent that my
sister should be taken away <span class="corr" id="xd19e5405" title=
"Source: to night">to-night</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the youngest brother protested, saying: &ldquo;If you will not
give her, I will. Do you not remember our father&rsquo;s words?&rdquo;
Thereupon he took his sister by the hand,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e5410src" href="#xd19e5410" name="xd19e5410src">5</a> and
presented her to the invisible wooer, saying: &ldquo;May she be a loyal
and dutiful wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment the princess passed over the threshold every one in the
palace fell to the ground in terror, so fearsome was the lightning and
so loud the peals of thunder. The whole building shook as if about to
fall. The storm, however, passed and daybreak came. That morning close
search was made to see if any trace could be found of the strange
visitant or the way it had gone; but, alas! all their efforts were
vain.</p>
<p>The second night, about the same time, a similar noise was heard
again round the palace, and a voice at the door exclaimed: &ldquo;O
princes, open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seized with fear they dared not disobey. Then the pitiless voice
spake again: &ldquo;Give me your second sister; I have come to ask her
in marriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eldest brother protested: &ldquo;I will not consent!&rdquo; The
second brother said: &ldquo;I will not give away our sister!&rdquo; But
the youngest brother was willing. &ldquo;I will give her!&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;have you already forgotten what our father commanded at the
hour of his death?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the youngest prince took his sister by the hand and
presented her to the unseen visitor, saying: &ldquo;Take her, may she
be loyal and dutiful to you!&rdquo; So the visitant departed with the
princess, and next morning no trace of him could be found.</p>
<p>The third night at the same hour the earth quaked and the palace
rocked on its foundations, so mighty was the tumult around it. And
again a mysterious voice was heard from without. The princes opened the
door, and the unseen presence entered and said: &ldquo;I come to ask
your youngest sister in marriage!&rdquo; The two elder brothers
exclaimed simultaneously: &ldquo;We will not give our sister by night;
we must know to whom we are giving her, so that we may visit her when
we wish to do so!&rdquo; But once more the youngest brother exclaimed:
&ldquo;I will give her, if you will not! Have you, then, forgotten what
our father told us? It is not so very long ago!&rdquo; So saying, he
took the maiden and presented her to the invisible power, saying:
&ldquo;Take her with you! And may she bring you joy and
happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5427">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5428" class="main">The Princes set Out</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next morning the brothers debated the fate of their
sisters, and sorrow filled their hearts. &ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo;
they said, &ldquo;what a mighty wonder! We know not what has befallen
our sisters; neither do we know where they have gone nor whom they have
married!&rdquo; At length they decided to go in search of their beloved
sisters, and making the necessary preparations for their journey they
set out on the quest.</p>
<p>They journeyed for some time and then lost their way in a dense
forest, in which they wandered for a whole day. When darkness fell,
they agreed that they must pass the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>night at some place
where they could find water, so when they came to a lake, they decided
to pass the night there, and sat down to eat. When they were ready to
compose themselves to sleep, the eldest proposed to his brothers that
they should sleep while he kept guard. So the two younger brothers went
to sleep, and the eldest watched.</p>
<p>About midnight the lake became agitated, and the watcher was seized
with horror when he saw in the middle of it something moving straight
toward him. As it came nearer, he saw clearly that it was a monstrous
alligator with two huge ears. The monster attacked the prince with all
its strength, but the gallant young man received it on the point of his
sword and swiftly cleft its head asunder. Then he cut off the ears,
placed them in his bag, but threw the carcass back into the lake. Soon
after this, morning broke; but the two younger brothers slept quietly
on, unconscious of their brother&rsquo;s exploit.</p>
<p>In due time the prince awakened the young men and, without
mentioning what had happened, he recommended that they should continue
their journey. They travelled the whole day long and, having again lost
their way in another dense forest, they decided to pass the coming
night by a small lake, and they quickly made a fire. After they had
eaten, the second brother said: &ldquo;To-night you two sleep, and I
shall watch.&rdquo; And so the eldest and the youngest brothers slept,
while the second kept guard.</p>
<p>Suddenly the water of the lake began to stir, and lo! an alligator
with two heads appeared and rushed furiously upon the three brothers.
But the second brother was no coward; he gave the monster a fearful
blow with his gleaming sabre and the alligator fell dead. Then the
prince cut off its four ears, placed them in his bag, and threw the
horrible carcass into the lake. The two sleeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>brothers knew nothing of all this and slept till
sun-rise. Then the gallant prince exclaimed: &ldquo;Get up, my
brothers, it is high time!&rdquo; And they instantly arose, and
prepared to continue their journey, without knowing whither they should
go.</p>
<p>A great fear seized their hearts when they found themselves in a
horrible desert; they wandered in this for three long days, and, as
their food was consumed, they feared now lest they should die of hunger
in this strange land, which seemed to have no end. Then they addressed
their fervent prayers to the Almighty that He might be pleased to
afford them some guidance, and lo! they saw at length a large sheet of
water. Great was now their joy, and they took counsel with each other
and agreed to pass the night on the shores of that lake.</p>
<p>Having quenched their thirst, they made a bright fire, and when the
hour for sleep approached, the youngest brother proposed:
&ldquo;To-night it is my turn; you two go to sleep and I shall
watch!&rdquo; So the two elder brothers went to sleep, and the youngest
brother kept awake, looking sharply about him, often casting his eyes
over the lake. Toward midnight he noticed a disturbance in the water,
and as he looked in wonder the lake grew so agitated that a wave
overflowed the shore and nearly extinguished the fire. The next moment
a horrible alligator with three heads appeared and rushed furiously on
the brothers, obviously intending to devour them. But the youngest
prince was no less brave than his two brothers; he unsheathed his
sword, and as the monster came on with jaws wide agape, he gave it
three fearful blows in rapid succession, slashing off its three heads.
Then he cut off the six ears and placed them in his bag, and threw the
body and the heads back into the lake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5450">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5451" class="main">The Nine Giants</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meantime the fire had smouldered out, and having no
materials with which to make a fresh fire, and not wishing to awake his
brothers, the prince went a short distance into the desert in the hope
of finding some fuel, but without success. He climbed upon a rock, and
looking around he saw at length the glare of a fire. As it seemed that
the fire was not very far off, he decided to go and get brands with
which to relight his own fire. So he descended from the rock and
hastening for some time through the desert, he came at last to a cave
in which he saw nine giants sitting round a big fire and roasting on
spits two men, one on each side. Upon the fire there stood a caldron
full of the limbs of men.</p>
<p>When the prince saw all this, he was seized with horror, and would
readily have gone back, but it was too late. So he saluted the giants
thus: &ldquo;Good evening, my comrades, I have been in search of you
for a long time!&rdquo; They welcomed him in a friendly manner and
returned the greeting, saying: &ldquo;May God favour you, since you are
one of us!&rdquo; The wily prince added: &ldquo;Why, I shall remain one
of your faithful friends for ever, and would give my life for your
sake!&rdquo; &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; exclaimed the giants, &ldquo;since you
intend to join us, no doubt you are ready to eat man&rsquo;s flesh, and
to join our company when we go in search of prey?&rdquo; Thereupon the
tsar&rsquo;s son answered: &ldquo;Most decidedly! I shall do willingly
everything that you, yourselves, do.&rdquo; Hearing this the giants
retorted: &ldquo;That is well for you then! Come and sit here with
us!&rdquo; Then the whole company, sitting round the fire, and taking
the meat out of the caldron, began to eat. The tsar&rsquo;s son
pretended to eat, but he deceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>them cleverly, for instead of
eating he threw the meat behind him.</p>
<p>After supper the giants exclaimed: &ldquo;Now let us go to hunt, for
we must have something to eat to-morrow!&rdquo; So they started out,
all nine of them, the prince being the tenth of the party. &ldquo;Come
with us,&rdquo; said the giants to the prince, &ldquo;we will go to a
neighbouring city in which lives a tsar: for from that city we have
been supplying ourselves with food for many years!&rdquo; When they
arrived at that place, the giants uprooted two fir-trees, and, reaching
the walls of the city, they placed one tree against it and ordered the
prince: &ldquo;Go up to the top of the wall, and we will hand you the
second tree, which you will fix on the other side of the wall, so that
we can climb down the stem of it into the city.&rdquo; The prince
obeyed, and, when he was on the top of the wall, he said: &ldquo;I do
not know how to do it, I am not familiar with this place, and I cannot
manage to throw the tree over the wall; please come up, one of you, and
show me how to do it!&rdquo; Thereupon one of the giants climbed up,
took the top of the tree and threw the stem over the wall, holding fast
the highest branch in his hands. The prince utilised this opportunity
to draw his sword, and, unseen by those below, with one stroke he cut
off the giant&rsquo;s head, and pushed his body over the wall. Then he
said to the others: &ldquo;Now come up one by one, so that I can let
you down into the city as I did our first comrade.&rdquo; The giants,
suspecting nothing, climbed up one after the other; and the prince cut
off their heads till he had killed the whole nine. Then he slowly
descended the pine-tree and reached the ground within the city
walls.</p>
<p>Walking through the streets he was surprised to see no living soul
there, and the whole city seemed to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>deserted! So he
reasoned to himself: &ldquo;Those ugly giants must have annihilated all
the inhabitants of this city!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5465">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5466" class="main">The Sleeping Princess</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He continued wandering about till he saw at length a
very tall tower, through one of the vent-holes of which shone a light.
He opened the door and went straight to the room from which he judged
the light to have come. It was magnificently decorated with gold and
velvet, and lying on a resplendent couch, was a maiden sleeping. The
girl was exceedingly beautiful, and as the prince devoured her with his
eyes he was horrified to see a snake on the wall; it poised its hideous
head with the obvious intention of striking the girl on her forehead
between the eyes, but the prince rushed swiftly forward with drawn
poniard and pierced the serpent&rsquo;s head so that it was nailed to
the wall, exclaiming as he did so: &ldquo;May God grant that my poniard
cannot be drawn out of the wall by any hand but mine!&rdquo; He then
hurried away, climbing the city wall by the same way as he had come.
When he arrived at the giants&rsquo; cave, he took a brand from the
fire, and hastened to the place where he had left his brothers, and
found them still sleeping. He made a fresh fire, and, as meantime the
sun had risen, he now awoke his brothers and they immediately continued
their journey. That same day they came to a road which led to the city
of which we have heard. It was the custom of the tsar who lived in that
city to walk abroad every morning and to lament the great destruction
of his people by the giants. His greatest anxiety was lest his only
daughter would one day be their prey. On this particular morning he
walked unusually early through the streets, which were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>all
empty. After a time he came to a part of the city wall against which
the tall pine-tree of the giants leaned. He approached closely and
found the bodies of the nine giants, the terrible enemies of his
people, lying upon the ground with their heads cut off. When the tsar
saw this wonder he rejoiced exceedingly, and the people soon gathered
around him and prayed that God might grant happiness and long life to
the hero who had killed the giants. At that very moment servants came
hurriedly from the palace and informed the tsar that a snake had very
nearly caused the death of his daughter. Hearing this the tsar ran to
his daughter, and entering her room he was amazed to see a large,
hideous serpent nailed to the wall. He tried at once to pluck out the
poniard, but was not able to do so.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5473width" id="p254"><img src="images/p254.jpg"
alt="He was horrified to see a snake on the wall" width="493" height=
"720">
<p class="figureHead">He was horrified to see a snake on the wall</p>
</div>
<p>Then the tsar issued a proclamation throughout his vast empire to
the effect that if the hero who had killed the nine giants and pierced
the snake would come to court he should receive great gifts and the
hand of the tsar&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. This proclamation spread
quickly all over the land, and by the tsar&rsquo;s orders, in every inn
on the principal roads an official was stationed whose duty it was to
ask every traveller if he had heard of the hero who had killed the nine
giants. If any man should know anything about the matter, he was at
once to come before the tsar and tell what he knew, and was to be
rewarded. And the tsar&rsquo;s commands were strictly carried out.</p>
<p>After some time the three princes in search of their sisters came to
pass the night at one of the inns of that country, and, after supper,
they began an animated conversation with the inn-keeper, in the course
of which the witty host boasted of his exploits, and at length asked
the princes: &ldquo;Tell me now, what heroic deeds have you young men
performed?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256"
name="pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the eldest brother started thus: &ldquo;When my brothers
and I set out on our expedition in search of our sisters, we decided to
pass the first night on the shores of a lake in the midst of a deserted
forest. There I proposed that my brothers should go to sleep while I
remained to keep watch. As soon as they fell asleep, a terrible
alligator rose from the lake to devour my brothers, but I received it
on the point of my sword and cleft its hideous head asunder: if you do
not believe, here are the ears of the monster!&rdquo; Saying this, the
eldest brother took out of his bag the ears of the alligator and placed
them on the table.</p>
<p>When the second brother heard this, he said: &ldquo;And I was on
guard, my brothers, while you were sleeping the second night; and from
the lake appeared an alligator with two heads. I rushed at it with my
sword and cut off both its heads: if you do not believe me, see! here
are the four ears of the monster!&rdquo; Saying this, he produced the
ears from his bag and placed them on the table to the great
astonishment of the listeners.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5486">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5487" class="main">The Hero Found</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the youngest brother kept silent. And the
inn-keeper asked him: &ldquo;By my faith, young man, your brothers are
veritable heroes, let us hear whether you have performed any heroic
exploit?&rdquo; Then the youngest brother began to relate: &ldquo;I
have also done a little. When we arrived at the shores of a lake on the
third night in that desert to pass the night, you, my brothers, went to
rest, and I remained awake to keep watch. About midnight, the lake was
greatly agitated and an alligator with three heads rushed out with the
intention of swallowing you, but I received it on the point of my sword
and successfully <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>cleft its three heads asunder: if you do
not believe me, see! here are the six ears of the monster!&rdquo; This
astounded even his brothers, and the young man continued:
&ldquo;Meantime our fire was extinguished, and I went in search of
fuel. Wandering over the desert, I came across nine giants ...&rdquo;
and so he proceeded to relate to them all his surprising deeds. When
the story came to an end the inn-keeper hurried off and told everything
to the tsar, who gave him money and ordered that the brothers should be
brought to him. When they appeared the tsar asked the youngest prince:
&ldquo;Is it really you who have done all those wonders in my city, and
saved the life of my only daughter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, your
Majesty!&rdquo; answered the prince. Thereupon the tsar moved with
great joy and gratitude, gave his daughter in marriage to the gallant
prince and appointed him his prime minister. As to his brothers, the
tsar said: &ldquo;If you wish to remain with your brother, I shall find
you wives and shall order castles to be built for you!&rdquo; But the
two princes thanked his Majesty and declared that they were already
married and that they wished to continue their search for their lost
sisters.</p>
<p>The tsar approved of this resolution, and having been supplied with
two mules loaded with gold the two brothers said their farewells and
departed. The youngest brother soon began to think of his three
sisters; he would have been sorry to leave his wife to go in search of
them, and in any case the tsar, his father-in-law, would not permit him
to leave the court. Nevertheless the prince wasted away slowly in grief
for his sisters.</p>
<p>One day the tsar went forth to hunt, and said to the
prince<span class="corr" id="xd19e5497" title="Source: !">:</span>
&ldquo;Remain in the palace, and take these nine keys and keep them in
your pocket. You can open three or four rooms with those keys, there
you will find unbounded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>gold, silver and precious stones.
In fact, if you wish to do so, you can open even the eight rooms, but
do not dare to open the ninth. Ill indeed will be your fate if you
do!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5502">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5503" class="main">Bash Tchelik</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As soon as the tsar had left the palace, the young
prince began to open the doors, one after the other, of all the eight
rooms, and truly he saw much gold, silver and other precious things. At
length he came to the ninth room, and reasoned to himself: &ldquo;I
have survived many extraordinary adventures, nothing ever surprised me;
why should I now be afraid to venture into this room?&rdquo; Saying
this, he opened the door, and what do you think he saw there? In the
middle of the room stood a strange man, whose legs were bound in iron
up to the knees and his arms up to the elbows; in the four corners of
the room there were chains fastened to thick beams, and all the chains
met in a ring round the man&rsquo;s neck, so that he could not make the
slightest movement. In front of him was a fountain from which the water
streamed through a golden pipe into a golden basin. Near him stood a
golden mug, incrusted with precious stones. Despite his longing to
drink the water, the man could not move to reach the mug. When the
prince saw all this, he was indeed astounded, and drew back, but the
man groaned: &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, come to me!&rdquo; The
prince approached him and the man said: &ldquo;Do a good deed! Give me
now a cup of water, and know for certain, that I will reward you with
another life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought within himself: &ldquo;Is there anything better
than to possess two lives?&rdquo; So he took the mug, filled it with
water, and handed it to the man, who drank <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>eagerly. Then the prince asked him: &ldquo;Tell
me now, what is your name?&rdquo; The man answered: &ldquo;My name is
Bash Tchelik (Real Steel).&rdquo; The prince made a movement toward the
door, but the man again implored him: &ldquo;Give me another mug of
water, and I shall give you a second life!&rdquo; The prince thought:
&ldquo;Now, if he gives me a second life, I shall have, together with
my own, three lives! This will be quite wonderful!&rdquo; So he again
filled the mug and handed it to the strange prisoner, who emptied it
greedily. The prince turned toward the door, but the man exclaimed:
&ldquo;O hero, do not go! Come back a moment! Since you have done two
good deeds, do yet a third, and I will give you a third life as reward.
Take this mug, fill it with water, and pour it over my head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince had no desire to refuse; he filled the cup with water,
and poured it over the man&rsquo;s head. No sooner had he done this
than Bash Tchelik broke the iron chains around his neck, jumped up with
the speed of lightning, and, lo! he had wings. He rushed through the
door before the surprised prince could make a movement, and, having
snatched up the daughter of the tsar, the wife of his deliverer, he
flew into the air and disappeared.</p>
<p>When the tsar returned from the hunt, his son-in-law told him all
that had happened, and the tsar was indeed greatly saddened, and
exclaimed: &ldquo;Why did you do this? Did I not tell you not to open
the ninth room?&rdquo; The prince humbly answered: &ldquo;Do not be
angry, I shall go in search of Bash Tchelik, for I must fetch my
wife.&rdquo; But the tsar tried to dissuade him, saying: &ldquo;Do not
go, for anything in the world! You do not yet know this man; it cost me
many an army before I succeeded in taking him prisoner. Remain in peace
where you are, and I will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>find for you a still better wife
than my daughter was, and rest assured that I shall continue to love
you as my own son!&rdquo; However, the young prince would not listen to
his father-in-law&rsquo;s advice, but took money for his travelling
expenses, saddled a horse and went in search of Bash Tchelik.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5518" class="main">The Prince finds his Sister</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some time later the young man came to a city. From the
window of a castle a girl cried out: &ldquo;O prince, alight from your
charger and come into our courtyard!&rdquo; The prince did as he was
invited; the girl met him in the courtyard, and he was greatly
astonished to recognize in her his eldest sister. They embraced and
kissed each other, and his sister said: &ldquo;Come within, my
brother.&rdquo; When they were inside, the prince asked his sister who
her husband was, and she answered: &ldquo;I have married the king of
dragons, and he has sworn that he will kill my brothers the first time
he comes across them. Therefore, I will hide you, and shall ask him
first what he would do to you if you appeared. Should he declare that
he would do you no harm, I would tell him of your presence.&rdquo; So
she hid both her brother and his horse. Toward evening the dragon flew
home, and the whole castle shone. As soon as he entered, he called his
wife: &ldquo;My dear, there is a smell of human bones! Tell me at once
who is here!&rdquo; She answered: &ldquo;There is nobody!&rdquo; But
the dragon added: &ldquo;That cannot be!&rdquo; Then his wife asked
him: &ldquo;Please answer truly, would you harm my brothers if one of
them should come here to see me?&rdquo; And the king of dragons said:
&ldquo;Your eldest and your second brother I would slaughter and roast,
but your youngest brother I would not harm.&rdquo; Then she said:
&ldquo;My youngest brother, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>and your brother-in-law, is
here.&rdquo; Thereupon the king said: &ldquo;Let him come in.&rdquo;
And when the prince appeared, the king of dragons stretched forth his
arms, embraced his brother-in-law, and said: &ldquo;Welcome, O
brother!&rdquo; And the prince answered: &ldquo;I hope you are
well?&rdquo; Then they related to each other all their adventures from
beginning to end, and sat down to supper.</p>
<p>At length the prince told his brother-in-law that he was searching
for Bash Tchelik, and the dragon advised him, saying, &ldquo;Do not go
any further! I will tell you all about him; the very day when he
escaped from his prison, I met him with five thousand of my dragons,
and, after a severe battle, he escaped victorious. So you see, there is
slender hope for you, alone, to overpower him. Therefore I advise you,
as a friend, to abandon your plan, and return home in peace; and if you
are in need of money I will give you any amount of it.&rdquo; But the
prince answered: &ldquo;I thank you very much for all your good wishes
and advice, but I cannot do otherwise than go in search of Bash
Tchelik!&rdquo; And he thought: &ldquo;Why should I not do so, since I
have three superfluous lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king of dragons saw that he could not dissuade the prince,
he handed a feather he was wearing to him, and said: &ldquo;Take this,
and if you are ever in need of my help, you have only to burn it, and I
will come at once to your aid with all my forces.&rdquo; The prince
thankfully took the feather and started once more in pursuit of Bash
Tchelik.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5529" class="main">The Second Sister</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wandering for some time he came at length to another
city, and, as he was riding under the tower of a magnificent castle, a
window opened and he heard a voice calling him: &ldquo;Alight from your
steed, O prince, and come into our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>courtyard!&rdquo; The prince
complied immediately, and when he entered the courtyard, he was greatly
surprised to see his second sister, who threw herself into his arms,
weeping for joy. Then she showed her brother into her private
apartment, and he asked: &ldquo;To whom are you married, sister
dear?&rdquo; And she answered: &ldquo;My husband is the king of the
eagles.&rdquo; When the king returned home his loving wife welcomed
him, but he exclaimed at once: &ldquo;Who is the daring man now in my
castle? Tell me directly!&rdquo; She lied and said: &ldquo;No
one!&rdquo; Then they began their supper, and the princess asked her
husband: &ldquo;Tell me truly, would you do any harm to my brothers if
one of them should dare to come here to see me?&rdquo; And the
eagle-king answered: &ldquo;As to your eldest and your second brother,
I declare that I would kill them; but your third brother I would
welcome and help as much as I could.&rdquo; Then she took heart and
told him: &ldquo;Here is my youngest brother, and your brother-in-law,
who has come to see us!&rdquo; Then the king ordered his servants to
bring the prince before him, and when the servants obeyed and the
prince appeared, he stood up and embraced and kissed his
brother-in-law, saying: &ldquo;Welcome, my dear brother-in-law!&rdquo;
And the prince, touched by his kindness, answered most courteously:
&ldquo;Thank you, my brother! I hope you are well!&rdquo; The king at
once bade him be seated at table, and after supper the prince related
his wonderful adventures, and finished by telling them about his search
for Bash Tchelik. Hearing this, the eagle-king counselled his
brother-in-law most urgently to give up his hazardous plan, adding:
&ldquo;Leave that fiend alone, O dear brother-in-law! I would advise
you to remain here; you will find everything you desire in my
castle.&rdquo; But the adventurous prince would not listen to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>this advice for a moment, and on the morrow he
prepared to resume his search for Bash Tchelik. Then the eagle-king,
seeing that the prince&rsquo;s resolution was unshakable, plucked out
of his garment a beautiful feather, handed it to his brother-in-law,
and said: &ldquo;Take this feather, O brother, and if you ever should
need my help you will have but to burn it, and I will at once come to
your aid with the whole of my army.&rdquo; The prince accepted the
feather most gratefully, took his leave, and went away in pursuit of
his enemy.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5538" class="main">The Third Sister</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After some time he came to a third city, in which he
found in the same manner his youngest sister. She was married to the
king of the falcons, who also welcomed him in a friendly manner, and
gave him a feather to burn in case of need.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5542">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5543" class="main">The Prince finds his Wife</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After wandering from one place to another, he finally
found his wife in a cave. When his wife saw him she exclaimed:
&ldquo;How in the world did you come here, my dear husband?&rdquo; And
he told her all about his adventures and said: &ldquo;Let us flee
together, my wife!&rdquo; But she replied: &ldquo;How could we flee,
when Bash Tchelik will surely overtake us: he would kill you, and he
would take me back and punish me.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the prince,
knowing well that he had three additional lives, persuaded his wife to
go with him.</p>
<p>No sooner had they left the cavern than Bash Tchelik heard of their
departure and hurried after them. In a short time he reached them, took
back the princess, and reproached the prince; &ldquo;O prince, you have
stolen your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>wife! This time I forgive you, because I
recollect having granted you three lives. So you can go, but if you
dare come again for your wife I shall kill you!&rdquo; Thereupon Bash
Tchelik disappeared with the princess, and her husband remained to
wonder what he should do next. At length he decided to try his luck
again, and when he was near the cave he chose a moment when Bash
Tchelik was absent, and again took away his wife. But Bash Tchelik
again learnt of their departure quickly, and in a short time reached
them again. Now he drew his bow at the prince, saying: &ldquo;Do you
prefer to be shot by this arrow, or to be beheaded by my sabre?&rdquo;
The prince asked to be pardoned again, and Bash Tchelik forgave him,
saying: &ldquo;I pardon you this time also, but know surely that should
you dare come again to take away your wife I shall kill you without
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince tried his luck yet a third time, and, being again caught
by Bash Tchelik, once more implored to be pardoned. Because he had
given him of his own free will three lives, Bash Tchelik listened to
his plea, but said: &ldquo;Be warned; do not risk losing the one life
God gave you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince, seeing that against such a power he could do nothing,
started homeward, pondering in his mind, however, how he could free his
wife from Bash Tchelik. Suddenly an idea came to him: he recalled what
his brothers-in-law had said when giving him a feather from their
garments. So he thought: &ldquo;I must go once more and try to rescue
my wife; if I come to any harm I will burn the feathers and my
brothers-in-law will come to my aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the prince returned to the cave of Bash Tchelik, and his
wife was greatly surprised to see him and exclaimed: &ldquo;So, you are
tired of life, since you have come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265"
href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>back a fourth time for
me!&rdquo; But the prince showed his wife the feathers and explained
their uses, and prevailed upon her to try once more to escape. No
sooner had they left the cavern, however, than Bash Tchelik rushed
after them shouting: &ldquo;Stop, prince! You cannot escape me!&rdquo;
The prince, seeing that they were in imminent peril, hastily burnt all
three feathers, and when Bash Tchelik came up with drawn sabre ready to
kill him, oh! what a mighty wonder! At the same moment came flying to
the rescue the dragon-king with his host of dragons, the eagle-king
with all his fierce eagles, and the falcon-king with all his falcons.
One and all fell furiously upon Bash Tchelik, but despite the shedding
of much blood Bash Tchelik seemed to be invincible, and at length he
seized the princess and fled.</p>
<p>After the battle the three brothers-in-law found the prince dead,
and immediately decided to recall him to life. They asked three dragons
which of them could bring, in the shortest possible time, some water
from the Jordan. The first said: &ldquo;I could bring it in half an
hour!&rdquo; The second declared: &ldquo;I will bring it in ten
minutes!&rdquo; The third asserted: &ldquo;I can bring it in nine
seconds!&rdquo; Thereupon the king dispatched the third dragon, and,
indeed, he used all his fiery might and returned in nine seconds. The
king took the healing water, poured it upon the gaping wounds of their
brother-in-law, and, as they did so, the wounds were healed up and the
prince sprang to his feet alive.</p>
<p>Then the kings counselled him: &ldquo;Since you have been saved from
death go home in peace.&rdquo; But the prince declared that he would
once more try to regain his beloved wife. The kings endeavoured to
dissuade him, saying: &ldquo;Do not go, for you will be lost if you do!
You know <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>well that you have now only the one life which
God gave you.&rdquo; But the prince would not listen. Thereupon the
kings said: &ldquo;Since it cannot be otherwise, then go! But do not
vainly think to flee with your wife! Request your wife to ask Bash
Tchelik where his strength lies, and then come and tell us, in order
that we may help you to conquer him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5566" class="main">The Secret of Strength</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This time the prince went stealthily to the cavern
and, as counselled by the kings, told his wife to inquire from Bash
Tchelik wherein lay his strength. When Bash Tchelik returned home that
evening, the princess asked: &ldquo;I pray you, tell me where lies your
strength?&rdquo; Bash Tchelik, hearing this laughed and said: &ldquo;My
strength is in my sabre!&rdquo; The princess knelt before the sabre and
began to pray. Thereupon Bash Tchelik burst into louder laughter,
exclaiming: &ldquo;O foolish woman! My strength is not in my sabre, but
in my bow and my arrows!&rdquo; Then the princess knelt before the bow
and the arrows, and Bash Tchelik, shouting with laughter, said:
&ldquo;O foolish woman! My strength is neither in my bow nor in my
arrows! But tell me who instructed you to ask me where my force lies?
If your husband were alive I could guess it was he who demanded
it!&rdquo; But the princess protested that no one urged her, and he
believed what she said.</p>
<p>After some time the prince came, and when his wife told him that she
could not learn anything from Bash Tchelik, he said: &ldquo;Try
again!&rdquo; and went away.</p>
<p>When Bash Tchelik returned home the princess began again to ask him
to tell the secret of his strength. Then he answered: &ldquo;Since you
esteem my heroism so much, I will tell you the truth about it.&rdquo;
And he began: &ldquo;Far <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>away from here is a high mountain,
in that mountain there lives a fox, in the fox is a heart, in that
heart there lives a bird: in that bird lies my whole strength. But it
is very hard to catch that fox, for it can turn itself into
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning, when Bash Tchelik left the cave, the prince came and
learned the secret from his wife. Then he went straight to his
brothers-in-law who, upon hearing his tale, went at once with him to
find the mountain. This they were not long in doing, and they loosed
eagles to chase the fox, whereat the fox quickly ran into a lake and
there it transformed itself into a six-winged duck. Then the falcons
flew to the duck and it mounted into the clouds. Seeing this, the
dragons pursued it; the duck changed again into a fox; the other eagles
surrounded it, and at length it was caught.</p>
<p>Then the three kings ordered the fox to be cut open and its heart
taken out. This done, they made a great fire and from the fox&rsquo;s
heart took a bird which they threw into the fire, and it was burnt to
death. So perished Bash Tchelik, and thus did the prince finally regain
his beloved and loyal wife.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5581" class="main">IX. The Golden Apple-tree and the Nine
Peahens</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once there was a king who had three sons. In the
garden of the palace grew a golden apple-tree, which, in one and the
same night would blossom and bear ripe fruit. But during the night a
thief would come and pluck the golden apples, and none could detect
him. One day the king deliberating with his sons, said: &ldquo;I would
give much to know what happens to the fruit of our apple-tree!&rdquo;
Thereupon the eldest son answered: &ldquo;I will mount guard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>to-night under the apple-tree, and we will see
who gathers the fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When evening came, the prince laid himself under the apple-tree to
watch; but as the apples ripened, he fell asleep and did not wake until
next morning, when the apples had vanished. He told his father what had
happened, and his brother, the second son, then offered to keep guard
that night. But he had no more success than his elder brother.</p>
<p>It was now the turn of the youngest son to try his luck, and, when
night came on, he placed a bed under the tree, and lay down and went to
sleep. About midnight he awoke and glanced at the apple-tree. And lo!
the apples were just ripening and the whole castle was lit up with
their shining. At that moment nine peahens flew to the tree and settled
on its branches, where eight remained to pluck the fruit. The ninth,
however, flew to the ground and was instantly transformed into a maiden
so beautiful that one might in vain search for her equal throughout the
kingdom.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5592width" id="p268"><img src="images/p268.jpg"
alt="The pea-hen instantly turned into a maiden" width="492" height=

<p class="figureHead">The pea-hen instantly turned into a maiden</p>
</div>
<p>The prince immediately fell madly in love with his visitor and the
fair maiden was not at all unwilling to stay and converse with the
young man. An hour or two soon passed but at last the maiden said that
she might stay no longer. She thanked the prince for the apples which
her sisters had plucked, but he asked that they would give him at least
one to carry home.</p>
<p>The maiden smiled sweetly and handed the young man two apples, one
for himself, the other for his father, the king. She then turned again
into a peahen, joined her sisters and all flew away.</p>
<p>Next morning the prince carried the two apples to his father. The
king, very pleased, praised his son, and on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>the
following night, the happy prince placed himself under the tree, as
before, next morning again bringing two apples to his father. After
this had happened for several nights, his two brothers grew envious,
because they had not been able to do what he had done. Then a wicked
old woman offered her services to the malcontent princes, promising
that she would reveal the secret to them. So on the next evening the
old woman stole softly under the bed of the young prince and hid
herself there. Soon afterward the prince came and at once went to sleep
just as before. When midnight came, lo! the peahens flew down as usual;
eight of them settling on the branches of the apple-tree, but the
ninth, descending on the bed of the prince, instantly turned into a
maiden. The old woman, seeing this strange metamorphosis, crept softly
near and cut off a lock of the maiden&rsquo;s hair, whereupon the girl
immediately arose, changed again into a peahen, and disappeared
together with her sisters. Then the young prince jumped up and
wondering what had been the reason for the sudden departure of his
beloved began to look around. He then saw the old woman, dragged her
from under his bed, and ordered his servants to fasten her to the tails
of four horses and so to destroy her.</p>
<p>But the peahens never came again, to the great sorrow of the prince,
and for all that he mourned and wept.</p>
<p>Weeping will not move any mountain, and at length the prince
resolved to go through the wide world in search of his sweetheart and
not return home until he had found her. As a good son, he asked leave
of his father who tried hard to make him give up such a hazardous
scheme and promised him a much more beautiful bride in his own vast
kingdom&mdash;for he was very sure that any maiden would be glad to
marry such a valiant prince. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5610">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5611" class="main">The Prince&rsquo;s Quest</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But all his fatherly advice was vain, so the king
finally allowed his son to do what his heart bade, and the sorrowful
prince departed with only one servant to seek his love. Journeying on
for a long time, he came at length to the shore of a large lake, near
which was a magnificent castle in which there lived a very old woman, a
queen, with her only daughter. The prince implored the aged queen,
&ldquo;I pray thee, grandmother, tell me what you can about the nine
golden peahens?&rdquo; The queen answered: &ldquo;O, my son, I know
those peahens well, for they come every day at noon to this lake and
bathe. But had you not better forget the peahens, and rather consider
this beautiful girl, she is my daughter and will inherit my wealth and
treasures, and you can share all with her.&rdquo; But the prince,
impatient to find the peahens, did not even listen to what the queen
was saying. Seeing his indifference, the old lady bribed his servant
and gave him a pair of bellows, saying: &ldquo;Do you see this? When
you go to-morrow to the lake, blow secretly behind your master&rsquo;s
neck, and he will fall asleep and will not be able to speak to the
peahens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faithless servant agreed to do exactly as the queen bade, and
when they went to the lake, he used the first favourable occasion and
blew with the bellows behind his poor master&rsquo;s neck, whereupon
the prince fell so soundly asleep that he resembled a dead man. Soon
after, the eight peahens flew to the lake, and the ninth alighted on
the prince&rsquo;s horse and began to embrace him, saying:
&ldquo;Arise, sweetheart! Arise, beloved one! Ah, do!&rdquo; Alas! the
poor prince remained as if dead. Then after the peahens had bathed, all
disappeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after their departure the prince woke up and asked his
servant: &ldquo;What has happened? Have they been here?&rdquo; The
servant answered that they had indeed been there; that eight of them
bathed in the lake, while the ninth caressed and kissed him, trying to
arouse him from slumber. Hearing this, the poor prince was so angry
that he was almost ready to kill himself.</p>
<p>Next morning the same thing happened. But on this occasion the
peahen bade the servant tell the prince that she would come again the
following day for the last time. When the third day dawned the prince
went again to the lake, and fearing to fall asleep he decided to gallop
along the marge instead of pacing slowly as before. His deceitful
servant, however, pursuing him closely, again found an opportunity for
using the bellows, and yet again the prince fell asleep.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward the peahens came; eight of them went as usual to
bathe, and the ninth alighted on the prince&rsquo;s horse and tried to
awaken him. She embraced him and spoke thus: &ldquo;Awake, my darling!
Sweetheart, arise! Ah, my soul!&rdquo; But her efforts were futile; the
prince was sleeping as if he were dead. Then she said to the servant:
&ldquo;When thy master awakes tell him to cut off the head of the nail;
then only he may be able to find me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this the peahen disappeared with her sisters, and they had
hardly disappeared when the prince awoke and asked his servant:
&ldquo;Have they been here?&rdquo; And the malicious fellow answered:
&ldquo;Yes; the one who alighted on your horse ordered me to tell you
that, if you wish to find her again, you must first cut off the head of
the nail.&rdquo; Hearing this the prince unsheathed his sword and
struck off his faithless servant&rsquo;s head. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span></p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5629">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5630" class="main">The Quest Resumed</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prince now resumed his pilgrimage alone, and after
long journeying he came to a mountain where he met a hermit, who
offered hospitality to him. In the course of conversation the prince
asked his host whether he knew anything about the nine peahens; the
hermit replied: &ldquo;O my son, you are really fortunate! God himself
has shown you the right way. From here to their dwelling is but half a
day&rsquo;s walk; to-morrow I will point you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince rose very early the next morning, prepared himself for
the journey, thanked the hermit for giving him shelter, and went on as
he was directed. He came to a large gate, and, passing through it, he
turned to the right; toward noon he observed some white walls, the
sight of which rejoiced him very much. Arriving at this castle he asked
the way to the palace of the nine peahens, and proceeding he soon came
to it. He was, of course, challenged by the guards, who asked his name
and whence he came. When the queen heard that he had arrived, she was
overwhelmed with joy, and turning into a maiden she ran swiftly to the
gate and led the prince into the palace.</p>
<p>There was great feasting and rejoicing when, later, their nuptials
were solemnized, and after the wedding the prince remained within the
palace and lived in peace.</p>
<p>Now one day the queen went for a walk in the palace grounds
accompanied by an attendant, the prince remaining in the palace. Before
starting the queen gave her spouse the keys of twelve cellars, saying:
&ldquo;You may go into the cellars, all but one; do not on any account
go into the twelfth; you must not even open the door!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prince soon began to speculate upon what there could possibly be
in the twelfth cellar; and having opened one cellar after the other, he
stood hesitatingly at the door of the twelfth. He who hesitates is
lost, and so the prince finally inserted the key in the lock and the
next moment had passed into the forbidden place. In the middle of the
floor was a huge cask bound tightly round with three strong iron hoops.
The bung-hole was open and from within the cask came a muffled voice
which said: &ldquo;I pray thee, brother, give me a drink of water, else
I shall die of thirst!&rdquo; The prince took a glass of water and
poured it through the bung-hole; immediately one hoop burst. Then the
voice spake again: &ldquo;O brother give me more water lest I should
die of thirst!&rdquo; The good-hearted prince emptied a second glass
into the cask, and a second hoop instantly came asunder. Again the
voice implored: &ldquo;O brother, give me yet a third glass! I am still
consumed by thirst!&rdquo; The prince made haste to gratify the unseen
speaker, and as he poured in the water the third hoop burst, the cask
fell in pieces, and a great dragon struggled out from the wreck, rushed
through the door and flew into the open. Very soon he fell in with the
queen, who was on her way back to the palace, and carried her off. Her
attendant, affrighted, rushed to the prince with the intelligence, and
the news came as a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>For a time the prince was as one distraught, but then he became more
calm and he resolved to set out again in search of his beloved queen.
In his wanderings he came to a river, and, walking along its bank, he
noticed in a little hole a small fish leaping and struggling. When the
fish saw the prince it began to beseech him piteously: &ldquo;Be my
brother-in-God! Throw me back into the stream; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>some
day I may, perhaps, be useful to you! But be sure to take a scale from
me, and when you are in need of help rub it gently.&rdquo; The prince
picked up the fish, took a scale from it, and threw the poor creature
into the water; then he carefully wrapped the scale in his
handkerchief.</p>
<p>Continuing his wanderings, he came to a place where he saw a fox
caught in an iron trap, and the animal addressed him, saying: &ldquo;Be
my brother-in-God! Release me, I pray, from this cruel trap; and some
day, perhaps, I may be helpful to you. Only take a hair from my brush,
and, if you are in need, rub it gently!&rdquo; The prince took a hair
from the fox&rsquo;s tail and set him free. Journeying on, he came upon
a wolf caught in a trap. And the wolf besought him in these words:
&ldquo;Be my brother-in-God, and release me! One day you may need my
help, therefore, take just one hair from my coat, and if you should
ever need my assistance, you will have but to rub it a little!&rdquo;
This likewise the prince did.</p>
<p>Some days elapsed and then, as the prince went wearily on his way,
he met a man in the mountains, to whom he said: &ldquo;O my
brother-in-God! Can you direct me to the castle of the king of the
dragons?&rdquo; Luckily the man knew of this castle and was able to
tell the way to it; he also informed the prince exactly how long the
journey would take.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5652" class="main">The Prince finds his Wife</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prince thanked the stranger and continued his
journey with fresh vigour until he came to where the king of the
dragons lived. He entered the castle boldly and found his wife there;
after their first joy of meeting, they began to consider how they could
escape. Finally, they took swift horses from the stables, but they had
hardly set out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>before the dragon came back. When he found that
the queen had escaped, he took counsel with his courser: &ldquo;What do
you advise? Shall we first eat and drink, or shall we pursue at
once!&rdquo; The horse answered: &ldquo;Let us first refresh ourselves,
for we shall surely catch them.&rdquo; After the meal, the dragon
mounted his horse and in a very few minutes they reached the fugitives.
Then he seized the queen and said to the prince: &ldquo;Go in peace! I
pardon you this time, because you released me from that cellar: but do
not venture to cross my path again, for you will not be forgiven a
second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor prince started sadly on his way, but he soon found that he
could not abandon his wife. Whatever the cost he must make another
attempt to rescue her, and so he retraced his steps, and on the
following day entered the castle again and found his wife in tears. It
was evident that they must use guile if they were to elude the magical
powers of the dragon-king, and after they had thought upon the matter,
the prince said: &ldquo;When the dragon comes home to-night, ask where
he got his horse; perchance I may be able to procure a steed that is
equally swift: only then could we hopefully make another attempt to
escape.&rdquo; Saying this he left his wife for a time. When the
dragon-king returned, the queen began to caress him and to pleasantly
converse; at length she said: &ldquo;How I admire your fine horse!
Certainly he is of no ordinary breed! Where did you find such a swift
courser?&rdquo; And the dragon-king replied: &ldquo;Ah! his like is not
to be got by every one! In a certain mountain lives an old woman, who
has in her stables twelve wondrous horses; none could easily tell which
is the finest! But in a corner stands one that is apparently leprous;
he is, in fact, the best of the stable, and whoever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>becomes his master, may ride even higher than
the clouds. My steed is a brother of those horses, and if anyone would
get a horse from that old woman he must serve her for three days. She
has a mare and a foal, and he who is her servant must tend them for
three days and three nights; if he succeeds in guarding them and
returns them to the old woman, he is entitled to choose a horse from
her stable. But, if the servant does not watch well over the mare and
its foal, he will indeed lose his life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5662">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5663" class="main">The old Woman and her Horses</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next morning, when the dragon had left the castle, the
prince came and the queen told him what she had heard. Hastily bidding
his wife farewell, he went with all speed to the mountain, and finding
the old woman, he said to her: &ldquo;God help you, grandmother!&rdquo;
And she returned the greeting: &ldquo;May God help you also, my son!
What good wind brought you here, and what do you wish?&rdquo; He
answered: &ldquo;I should like to serve you.&rdquo; Thereupon the old
woman said: &ldquo;Very well, my son! If you successfully watch my mare
and its foal for three days, I shall reward you with a horse which you
yourself are at liberty to choose from my stable; but if you do not
keep them safe, you must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she led the prince into her courtyard, where he saw stakes all
around placed close together, and on each save one was stuck a human
head. The one stake kept shouting out to the old woman: &ldquo;Give me
a head, O grandmother! Give me a head!&rdquo; The old woman said:
&ldquo;All these are heads of those who once served me; they did not
succeed in keeping my mare and its foal safe, so they had to pay with
their heads!&rdquo; But the prince was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>not to be frightened
at what he saw, and he readily accepted the old woman&rsquo;s
conditions.</p>
<p>When evening came, he mounted the mare and rode it to pasture, the
foal following. He remained seated on the mare, but, toward midnight,
he dozed a little and finally fell fast asleep. When he awoke he saw,
to his great consternation, that he was sitting upon the trunk of a
tree holding the mare&rsquo;s bridle in his hand. He sprang down and
went immediately in search of the tricky animal. Soon he came to a
river, the sight of which reminded him of the little fish, and taking
the scale from his handkerchief, he rubbed it gently between his
fingers, when lo! the fish instantly appeared and asked: &ldquo;What is
the matter, my brother-in-God?&rdquo; The prince answered: &ldquo;My
mare has fled, and I do not know where to look for her!&rdquo; And the
fish answered: &ldquo;Here she is with us, turned into a fish, and her
foal into a small one! Strike once upon the water with the bridle and
shout: <span class="corr" id="xd19e5673" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>Doora! Mare of the old
woman!<span class="corr" id="xd19e5676" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince did as the fish told him; at once the mare and her foal
came out of the water; he bridled the mare, mounted and rode home; the
young foal trotting after. The old woman brought the prince some food
without a word; then she took the mare into the stable, beat her with a
poker, and said: &ldquo;Did I not tell you to go down among the
fish?&rdquo; The mare answered: &ldquo;I have been down to the fish,
but the fish are his friends and they betrayed me to him.&rdquo;
Thereupon the old woman said: &ldquo;To-night you go among the
foxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When evening came, the prince mounted the mare again and rode to the
field, the foal following its mother. He determined again to remain in
the saddle and to keep watch, but, toward midnight, he was again
overcome by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>drowsiness and became unconscious. When he awoke
next morning, lo! he was seated on a tree-trunk holding fast the
bridle. This alarmed him greatly, and he looked here and he looked
there. But search as he would, he could find no trace of the mare and
her foal. Then he remembered his friend the fox, and taking the hair
from the fox&rsquo;s tail out of his handkerchief, he rubbed it gently
between his fingers, and the fox instantly stood before him.
&ldquo;What is the matter, my brother-in-God?&rdquo; said he. The
prince complained of his misfortune, saying that he had hopelessly lost
his mare. The fox soon reassured him: &ldquo;The mare is with us,
changed to a fox, and her foal into a cub; just strike once with the
bridle on the earth, and shout out &lsquo;Doora, the old woman&rsquo;s
mare!&rsquo;&rdquo; He did so, and sure enough the mare at once
appeared before him with the foal. So he bridled her and mounted, and
when he reached home the old woman gave him food, and took the mare to
the stable and beat her with a poker, saying: &ldquo;Why did you not
turn into a fox, you disobedient creature?&rdquo; And the mare
protested: &ldquo;I did turn into a fox; but the foxes are his friends,
so they betrayed me!&rdquo; At this the old woman commanded:
&ldquo;Next time you go to the wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When evening came the prince set out on the mare and the same things
befell as before. He found himself, the next morning, sitting on a
tree-trunk, and this time he called the wolf, who said: &ldquo;The mare
of the old woman is with us in the likeness of a she-wolf, and the foal
of a wolf&rsquo;s cub; strike the ground once with the bridle and
exclaim: &lsquo;Doora! the mare of the old woman!&rsquo;&rdquo; The
prince did as the wolf counselled, and the mare reappeared with her
foal standing behind her.</p>
<p>He mounted once again and proceeded to the old woman&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>house, where, on his arrival, he found her
preparing a meal. Having set food before him, she took the mare to the
stable and beat her with a poker. &ldquo;Did I not tell you to go to
the wolves, you wretched creature?&rdquo; she scolded. But the mare
protested again, saying: &ldquo;I did go to the wolves, but they are
also his friends and they betrayed me!&rdquo; Then the old woman went
back to the house and the prince said to her: &ldquo;Well, grandmother,
I think I have served you honestly; now I hope you will give me what
you promised me!&rdquo; The old woman replied: &ldquo;O my son, verily
a promise must be fulfilled! Come to the stable; there are twelve
horses; you are at liberty to choose whichever you like
best!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5691">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5692" class="main">The Prince&rsquo;s Choice</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thereupon the prince said firmly: &ldquo;Well, why
should I be particular? Give me the leprous horse, standing in that
corner.&rdquo; The old woman tried by all means in her power to deter
him from taking that ugly horse, saying: &ldquo;Why be so foolish as to
take that leprous jade when you can have a fine horse?&rdquo; But the
prince kept to his choice, and said: &ldquo;Give me rather the one I
selected, as it was agreed between us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman, seeing that he would not yield, gave way, and the
prince took leave of her and led away his choice. When they came to a
forest he curried and groomed the horse, and it shone as if its skin
were of pure gold. Then he mounted, and, the horse flying like a bird,
they reached the dragon-king&rsquo;s castle in a few seconds.</p>
<p>The prince immediately entered and greeted the queen with:
&ldquo;Hasten, all is ready for our flight!&rdquo; The queen was ready,
and in a few seconds they were speeding away, swift as the wind, on the
back of the wonderful horse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href=
"#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after they had gone, the dragon-king came home, and finding
that the queen had again disappeared, he addressed the following words
to his horse: &ldquo;What shall we do now? Shall we refresh ourselves,
or shall we go after the fugitives at once?&rdquo; And his horse
replied: &ldquo;We may do as you will, but we shall never reach
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this the dragon-king at once flung himself upon his
horse and they were gone in a flash. After a time the prince looked
behind him and saw the dragon-king in the distance. He urged his horse,
but it said: &ldquo;Be not afraid! There is no need to run
quicker.&rdquo; But the dragon-king drew nearer, so close that his
horse was able to speak thus to its brother: &ldquo;O brother dear,
tarry, I beseech you! else I shall perish in running at this
speed!&rdquo; But the prince&rsquo;s horse answered: &ldquo;Nay, why be
so foolish as to carry that monster? Fling up your hoofs and throw him
against a rock, then come with me!&rdquo; At these words the
dragon-king&rsquo;s horse shook its head, curved its back, and kicked
up its hoofs so furiously that its rider was flung on to a rock and
killed. Seeing this, the prince&rsquo;s horse stood still, its brother
trotted up, and the queen mounted on it. So they arrived happily in her
own land, where they lived and ruled in great prosperity ever
after.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king who had an only son, whom, when
he had grown up, he sent abroad to seek a suitable wife. The prince set
out on his journey, but, although he travelled over the whole world, he
did not succeed in finding a bride. Finally, after having exhausted his
patience and his purse, he decided to die, and, that there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>should not remain any trace of him, he climbed a
high mountain, intending to throw himself from the summit. He was on
the point of jumping from the pinnacle, when a voice uttered these
mysterious words: &ldquo;Stop! Stop! O man! Do not kill yourself, for
the sake of three hundred and sixty-five which are in the
year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince endeavoured in vain to discover whence the voice came,
and, seeing no one, he asked: &ldquo;Who are you that speak to me? Show
yourself! If you knew of my troubles, you would surely not hinder
me!&rdquo; Thereupon an old man appeared, with hair as white as snow,
and said to the unfortunate prince: &ldquo;I am well aware of all you
suffer; but listen to me. Do you see yonder high hill?&rdquo; The
king&rsquo;s son answered: &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; continued the old man, &ldquo;seated day and night in the
same spot on the summit of that hill there is an old woman with golden
hair, and she holds a bird in her lap. He who succeeds in securing that
bird will be the happiest man in the world. But if you wish to try your
luck you must be cautious; you must approach the old woman quietly,
and, before she sees you, you must take her by the hair. Should she see
you before you seize her, you will be turned to stone then and there,
just as it has happened to many young men whom you will see there in
the form of blocks of marble.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5715" class="main">The Old Witch</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the prince heard these words, he reflected:
&ldquo;It is all one to me; I shall go, and, if I succeed in seizing
her, so much the better for me; but if she should see me before I catch
her, I can but die, as I had already resolved to do.&rdquo; So he
thanked the old man, and went cheerfully to try his luck. He soon
climbed the other hill and saw the old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>woman, whom he
approached very warily from behind. Fortunately the old woman was
absorbed in playing with the bird, and so the prince was able to get
quite near without being perceived. Then he sprang suddenly forward and
seized the old woman by her golden hair; whereupon she screamed so
loudly that the whole hill shook as with an earthquake. But the
courageous prince held her fast. Then the old woman exclaimed:
&ldquo;Release me, and ask whatever you wish!&rdquo; And the prince
answered: &ldquo;I will do so if you let me have that bird, and if you
at once recall to life all these young men whom you have
bewitched.&rdquo; The old woman was forced to consent, and she gave up
the bird. Then from her lips she breathed a blue wind toward the
petrified figures, so that instantly they became living men once more.
The noble prince expressed the joy in his heart by kissing the bird in
his hands, whereupon it was transformed into a most beautiful girl,
whom, it appeared, the enchantress had bewitched in order to lure young
men to a horrid fate. The king&rsquo;s son was so pleased with his
companion that he promptly fell in love with her. On their way from
that place the maiden gave him a stick, and told him that it would do
everything he might wish. Presently the prince wished that he had the
wherewithal to travel as befitted a prince and his bride; he struck a
rock with the stick, and out poured a torrent of golden coins, from
which they took all they needed for their journey. When they came to a
river, the prince touched the water with his stick, and a dry path
appeared, upon which they crossed dryshod. A little farther on they
were attacked by a pack of wolves, but the prince protected his bride
with his stick, and one by one the wolves were turned into ants.</p>
<p>And many other adventures they had, but in the end they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=

they married and they lived happily ever after.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day a father sent his boy to the mill with corn to
be ground, and, at the moment of his departure, he warned him not to
grind it in any mill where he should happen to find a beardless
man.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e5736src" href="#xd19e5736" name=
"xd19e5736src">6</a></p>
<p>When the boy came to a mill, he was therefore disappointed to find
that the miller was beardless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Beardless!&rdquo; saluted the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God help you!&rdquo; returned the miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I grind my corn here?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo; responded the beardless one, &ldquo;my
corn will be soon ground; you can then grind yours as long as you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy, remembering his father&rsquo;s warning, left this mill
and went to another up the brook. But Beardless took some grain and,
hurrying by a shorter way, reached the second mill first and put some
of his corn there to be ground. When the boy arrived and saw that the
miller was again a beardless man, he hastened to a third mill; but
again Beardless hurried by a short cut, and reached it before the boy.
He did the same at a fourth mill, so that the boy concluded that all
millers are beardless men. He therefore put down his sack, and when the
corn of Beardless was ground he took his turn at the mill. When all of
his grain had been ground Beardless proposed: &ldquo;Listen, my boy!
Let us make a loaf of your flour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had not forgotten his father&rsquo;s injunction to have
nothing to do with beardless millers, but as he saw no way out of it,
he accepted the proposal. So Beardless now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>took
all the flour, mixed it with water, which the boy brought him, and thus
made a very large loaf. Then they fired the oven and baked the loaf,
which, when finished, they placed against the wall.</p>
<p>Then the miller proposed: &ldquo;Listen, my boy! If we were now to
divide this loaf between us, there would be little enough for either of
us, let us therefore tell each other stories, and whoever tells the
greatest lie shall have the whole loaf for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy reflected a little and, seeing no way of helping himself,
said: &ldquo;Very well, but you must begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Beardless told various stories till he got quite tired. Then
the boy said: &ldquo;Eh, my dear Beardless, it is a pity if you do not
know any more, for what you have said is really nothing; only listen,
and I shall tell you now the real truth.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In my young days, when I was an old man, we
possessed many beehives, and I used to count the bees every morning; I
counted them easily enough, but I could never contrive to count the
beehives. Well, one morning, as I was counting the bees, I was greatly
surprised to find that the best bee was missing, so I saddled a cock,
mounted it, and started in search of my bee. I traced it to the
sea-shore, and saw that it had gone over the sea, so I decided to
follow it. When I had crossed the water, I discovered that a peasant
had caught my bee; he was ploughing his fields with it and was about to
sow millet. So I exclaimed: &lsquo;That is my bee! How did you get
it?&rsquo; And the ploughman answered: &lsquo;Brother, if this is
really your bee, come here and take it!&rsquo; So I went to him and he
gave me back my bee, and a sack full of millet on account of the
services my bee had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285"
name="pb285">285</a>]</span>rendered him. Then I put the sack on my
back, and moved the saddle from the cock to the bee. Then I mounted,
and led the cock behind me that it might rest a little. As I was
crossing the sea, one of the strings of my sack burst, and all the
millet poured into the water. When I had got across, it was already
night, so I alighted and let the bee loose to graze; as to the cock, I
fastened him near me, and gave him some hay. After that I laid myself
down to sleep. When I rose next morning, great was my surprise to see
that during the night, the wolves had slaughtered and devoured my bee;
and the honey was spread about the valley, knee-deep and ankle-deep on
the hills. Then I was puzzled to know in what vessel I could gather up
all the honey. Meantime I remembered I had a little axe with me, so I
went into the woods to catch a beast, in order to make a bag of its
skin. When I reached the forest, I saw two deer dancing on one leg; so
I threw my axe, broke their only leg and caught them both. From those
two deer I drew three skins and made a bag of each, and in them
gathered up all the honey. Then I loaded the cock with the bags and
hurried homeward. When I arrived home I found that my father had just
been born, and I was told to go to heaven to fetch some holy water. I
did not know how to get there, but as I pondered the matter I
remembered the millet which had fallen into the sea. I went back to
that place and found that the grain had grown up quite to heaven, for
the place where it had fallen was rather damp, so I climbed up by one
of the stems. Upon reaching heaven I found that the millet had ripened,
and an angel had harvested the grain and had made a loaf of it, and was
eating it with some warm milk. I greeted him, saying: &lsquo;God bless
you!&rsquo; The angel responded: &lsquo;May God help <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>you!&rsquo; and gave me some holy water. On my
way back I found that there had been a great rain, so that the sea had
risen so high that my millet was carried away! I was frightened as to
how I should descend again to earth, but at length I remembered that I
had long hair&mdash;it is so long that when I am standing upright it
reaches down to the ground, and when I sit it reaches to my ears. Well,
I took out my knife and cut off one hair after another, tying them end
to end as I descended on them. Meantime darkness overtook me before I
got to the bottom, and so I decided to make a large knot and to pass
the night on it. But what was I to do without a fire! The tinder-box I
had with me, but I had no wood. Suddenly I remembered that I had in my
vest a sewing needle, so I found it, split it and made a big fire,
which warmed me nicely; then I laid myself down to sleep. When I fell
asleep, unfortunately a flame burnt the hair through, and, head over
heels, I fell to the ground, and sank into the earth up to my girdle. I
moved about to see how I could get out, and, when I found that I was
tightly interred, I hurried home for a spade and came back and dug
myself out. As soon as I was freed, I took the holy water and started
for home. When I arrived reapers were working in the field. It was such
a hot day, that I feared the poor men would burn to death, and called
to them: &lsquo;Why do you not bring here our mare which is two
days&rsquo; journey long and half a day broad, and on whose back large
willows are growing; she could make some shade where you are
working?&rsquo; My father hearing this, quickly brought the mare, and
the reapers continued working in the shade. Then I took a jug in which
to fetch some water. When I came to the well, I found the water was
quite frozen, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span>I took my head off and broke the ice with
it; then I filled the jug and carried the water to the reapers. When
they saw me they asked me: &lsquo;Where is your head?&rsquo; I lifted
my hand, and, to my great surprise, my head was not upon my shoulders,
and then I remembered having left it by the well. I went back at once,
but found that a fox was there before me, and was busy devouring my
head. I approached slowly and struck the beast fiercely with my foot,
so that in great fear, it dropped a little book. This I picked up and
on opening it, found written in it these words: &lsquo;The whole loaf
is for thee, and Beardless is to get nothing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, the boy took hold of the loaf and made off. As for
Beardless, he was speechless, and remained gazing after the boy in
astonishment.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5781" class="main">XII. The Maiden Wiser than the
Tsar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived an old man, who dwelt in a poor
cottage. He possessed one thing only in the world, and that was a
daughter who was so wise that she could teach even her old father.</p>
<p>One day the man went to the tsar to beg, and the tsar, astonished at
his cultivated speech, asked him whence he came and who had taught him
to converse so well. He told the tsar where he lived, and that it was
his daughter who had taught him to speak with eloquence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was your daughter taught?&rdquo; asked the
tsar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God and our poverty have made her wise,&rdquo; answered the
poor man.</p>
<p>Thereupon the tsar gave him thirty eggs and said: &ldquo;Take these
to your daughter, and command her in my name to bring forth chickens
from them. If she does this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>successfully I will give her rich
presents, but if she fails you shall be tortured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor man, weeping, returned to his cottage and told all this to
his daughter. The maiden saw at once that the eggs which the tsar had
sent were boiled, and bade her father rest while she considered what
was to be done. Then while the old man was sleeping the girl filled a
pot with water and boiled some beans.</p>
<p>Next morning she woke her father and begged him to take a plough and
oxen and plough near the road where the tsar would pass. &ldquo;When
you see him coming,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;take a handful of beans,
and while you are sowing them you must shout: &lsquo;Go on, my oxen,
and may God grant that the boiled beans may bear fruit!&rsquo;
Then,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when the tsar asks you, &lsquo;How can
you expect boiled beans to bear fruit?&rsquo; answer him: &lsquo;just
as from boiled eggs one can produce chicks!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man did as his daughter told him, and went forth to plough.
When he saw the tsar he took out a handful of beans, and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Go on, my oxen! And may God grant that the boiled beans may bear
fruit!&rdquo; Upon hearing these words the tsar stopped his carriage,
and said to the man: &ldquo;My poor fellow, how can you expect boiled
beans to bear fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as from boiled eggs one can produce chicks!&rdquo;
answered the apparently simple old man.</p>
<p>The tsar laughed and passed on, but he had recognized the old man,
and guessed that his daughter had instructed him to say this. He
therefore sent officers to bring the peasant into his presence. When
the old man came, the tsar gave him a bunch of flax, saying:
&ldquo;Take this, and make out of it all the sails necessary for a
ship; if you do not, you shall lose your life.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poor man took the flax with great fear, and went home in tears
to tell his daughter of his new task. The wise maiden soothed him, and
said that if he would rest she would contrive some plan. Next morning
she gave her father a small piece of wood, and bade him take it to the
tsar with the demand that from it should be made all the necessary
tools for spinning and weaving, that he should thereby be enabled to
execute his Majesty&rsquo;s order. The old man obeyed, and when the
tsar heard the extraordinary request he was greatly astounded at the
astuteness of the girl, and, not to be outdone, he took a small glass,
saying: &ldquo;Take this little glass to your daughter, and tell her
she must empty the sea with it, so that dry land shall be where the
ocean now is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man went home heavily to tell this to his daughter. But the
girl again reassured him, and next morning she gave him a pound of tow,
saying: &ldquo;Take this to the tsar and say, that when with this tow
he dams the sources of all rivers and streams I will dry up the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5811">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5812" class="main">The Tsar Sends for the Girl</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The father went back to the tsar and told him what his
daughter had said, and the tsar, seeing that the girl was wiser than
himself, ordered that she should be brought before him. When she
appeared the tsar asked her: &ldquo;Can you guess what it is that can
be heard at the greatest distance?&rdquo; and the girl answered:
&ldquo;Your Majesty, there are two things: the thunder and the lie can
be heard at the greatest distance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished tsar grasped his beard, and, turning to his
attendants, exclaimed: &ldquo;Guess what my beard is worth?&rdquo; Some
said so much, others again so much; but the maiden observed to the tsar
that none of his courtiers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>had guessed right. &ldquo;His
Majesty&rsquo;s beard is worth as much as three summer rains,&rdquo;
she said. The tsar, more astonished than ever, said: &ldquo;The maiden
has guessed rightly!&rdquo; Then he asked her to become his wife, for
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; said he. The girl had become enamoured of the
tsar, and she bowed low before him and said: &ldquo;Your glorious
Majesty! Let it be as you wish! But I pray that your Majesty may be
graciously pleased to write with your own hand on a piece of parchment
that should you or any of your courtiers ever be displeased with me,
and in consequence banish me from the palace, I shall be allowed to
take with me any one thing which I like best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tsar gladly consented, wrote out this declaration and affixed
his signature.</p>
<p>Some years passed by happily but there came at last a day when the
tsar was offended with the tsarina and he said angrily: &ldquo;You
shall be no longer my wife, I command you to leave my
palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tsarina answered dutifully: &ldquo;O most glorious tsar, I will
obey; permit me to pass but one night in the palace, and to-morrow I
will depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the tsar assented.</p>
<p>That evening, at supper, the tsarina mixed certain herbs in wine and
gave the cup to the tsar, saying: &ldquo;Drink, O most glorious tsar!
And be of good cheer! I am to go away, but, believe me, I shall be
happier than when I first met you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tsar, having drunk the potion fell asleep. Then the tsarina who
had a coach in readiness, placed the tsar in it and carried him off to
her father&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>When his Majesty awoke next morning and saw that he was in a
cottage, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Who brought me here?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered the tsarina.</p>
<p>The tsar protested, saying: &ldquo;How have you dared do so? Did I
not tell you that you are no longer my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering the tsarina produced the parchment containing
the tsar&rsquo;s promise and he could not find a word to say.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5843width" id="p290"><img src="images/p290.jpg"
alt="He could not find a word to say" width="492" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">He could not find a word to say</p>
</div>
<p>Then the tsarina said: &ldquo;As you see, you promised that should I
be banished from your palace I should be at liberty to take with me
that which I liked best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the tsar&rsquo;s love for his spouse returned, he took
her in his arms, and they returned to the palace together.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5852" class="main">XIII. Good Deeds Never Perish</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived a man and woman who had
one son. When the boy grew up his parents endeavoured to give him a
suitable education which would be useful in his after life. He was a
good, quiet boy, and above all he feared God. After he had completed
his studies, his father intrusted him with a galley laden with various
goods, so that he might trade with distant countries, and be the
support of his parents&rsquo; old age.</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5856">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5857" class="main">The First Voyage</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On his first voyage he one day met with a Turkish
ship, in which he heard weeping. So he called to the sailors on the
Turkish vessel: &ldquo;I pray you, tell me why there is such sorrow on
board your ship!&rdquo; And they answered: &ldquo;We have many slaves
whom we have captured in various parts of the world, and those who are
chained are weeping and lamenting.&rdquo; Thereupon the young man said:
&ldquo;Pray, O brethren, ask your captain if he will allow me to ransom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>the slaves for a sum of money?&rdquo; The
sailors gladly called their captain, who was willing to bargain, and in
the end the young man gave his ship with all its cargo to the Turk, in
exchange for his vessel containing the slaves.</p>
<p>The young man asked each slave whence he came, and gave to all their
freedom, and said that each might return to his own country.</p>
<p>Among the slaves was an old woman who held a most beautiful maiden
by the arm. When he asked whence they came, the old woman answered
through her tears: &ldquo;We come from a far-away country. This young
girl is the only daughter of the tsar, whom I have brought up from her
infancy. One unlucky day she was walking in the palace gardens, and
wandered to a lonely spot, where those accursed Turks saw her and
seized her. She began to scream, and I, who happened to be near, ran to
help her, but alas! I could not save her, and the Turks carried us both
on board this galley.&rdquo; Then the good nurse and the beautiful
girl, not knowing the way to their own country, and having no means of
returning thither, implored the young man to take them with him. And
this he was quite willing to do; indeed, he had immediately fallen in
love with the princess, and he now married the poor homeless maiden,
and, together with her and the old woman, returned home.</p>
<p>On their arrival, his father asked where his galley and its cargo
were, and he told him how he had ransomed the slaves and set them at
liberty. &ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the daughter of a
tsar, and this old woman is her nurse; as they could not return to
their country I took them with me, and I have married the
maiden.&rdquo; Thereupon his father grew very angry, and said: &ldquo;O
foolish son, what have you done? Why did you dispose so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>stupidly of my property without my
permission?&rdquo; and he drove him out of the house.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the young man, a good neighbour offered him
hospitality, and, with his wife and her old nurse, he resided for a
long time near by, endeavouring, through the influence of his mother
and friends, to persuade his father to forgive him.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5873">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5874" class="main">The Second Voyage</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After some time the father relented, and received his
son again in his house, together with his young wife and her nurse.
Soon after, he purchased a second galley, larger and finer than the
first, and loaded it with merchandise wherewith his son might trade to
great profit, if so be that he were wise.</p>
<p>The young man sailed in this new vessel, leaving his wife and her
nurse in the house of his parents, and soon came to a certain city,
where he beheld a sorrowful sight. He saw soldiers busied in seizing
poor peasants and throwing them into prison, and he asked: &ldquo;Why,
brethren, are you showing such cruelty to these unfortunate
people?&rdquo; And the soldiers replied: &ldquo;Because they have not
paid the tsar&rsquo;s taxes.&rdquo; The young man at once went to the
officer and said: &ldquo;I pray you, tell me how much these poor people
must pay.&rdquo; The officer told him the amount due, and, without
hesitation, the young man sold his galley and the cargo, and discharged
the debts of all the prisoners. He now returned home, and, falling at
the feet of his father, he told him the story and begged that he might
be forgiven. But his father grew exceedingly angry this time, and drove
him away from his house.</p>
<p>What could the unhappy son do in this fresh trouble? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>How
could he beg, he whose parents were so well-to-do? Old friends of the
family again used their influence with his father, urging that he
should take pity on his son and receive him back, &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;it is certain that suffering has made him wiser, and
that he will never again act so foolishly.&rdquo; At length his father
yielded, took him again into his house, and prepared a third galley for
him, much larger and finer than the two former ones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5884">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5885" class="main">The Third Voyage</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The young man was overjoyed at his good fortune, and
he had the portrait of his beloved wife painted on the helm, and that
of the old nurse on the stern. When all the preparations for a new
voyage were completed, he took leave of his parents, his wife, and
other members of the family, and weighed anchor. After sailing for some
time he arrived at a great city, in which there lived a tsar, and,
dropping anchor, he fired his guns as a salute to the city. Toward
evening the tsar sent one of his ministers to learn who the stranger
was and whence he came, and to inform him that his master would come at
nine o&rsquo;clock next morning to visit the galley. The minister was
astounded to see on the helm the portrait of the imperial
princess&mdash;whom the tsar had promised to him in marriage when she
was still a child&mdash;and on the stern that of the old nurse; but he
did not make any remark, nor did he tell anyone at the palace what he
had seen. At nine o&rsquo;clock next morning the tsar came on board the
galley with his ministers, and, as he paced the deck, conversing with
the captain, he also saw the portrait of the maiden painted on the helm
and that of the old woman on the stern, and he recognized at once the
features of his only daughter and her nurse, whom the Turks had
captured. At once he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span>conceived the hope that his beloved child
was alive and well, but he could not trust himself to speak, so great
was his emotion. Composing himself as best he could, he invited the
captain to come at two o&rsquo;clock that afternoon to his palace,
intending to question him, hoping thus to confirm the hopes of his
heart.</p>
<p>Punctually at two o&rsquo;clock the captain appeared at the palace,
and the tsar at once began to question him in a roundabout manner as to
the maiden whose portrait he had seen on the helm of his galley. Was
she one of his relations, and, if so, in what degree? He was also
curious concerning the old woman whose likeness was painted on the
stern.</p>
<p>The young captain guessed at once that the tsar must be his
wife&rsquo;s father, and he related to him word by word all his
adventures, not omitting to say that, having found that the young
maiden and her nurse had forgotten the way back to their country, he
had taken pity on them and later had espoused the maiden. Hearing this
the tsar exclaimed: &ldquo;That girl is my only child and the old woman
is her nurse; hasten and bring my daughter here that I may see her once
more before I die. Bring here also your parents and all your family;
your father will be my brother and your mother my sister, for you are
my son and the heir to my crown. Go and sell all your property and come
that we may live together in my palace!&rdquo; Then he called the
tsarina, his wife, and all his ministers, that they might hear the
joyful news, and there was great joy in the court.</p>
<p>After this the tsar gave the captain a magnificent ship requesting
him to leave his own galley behind. The young man was, of course, very
grateful, but he said: &ldquo;O glorious tsar! My parents will not
believe me, if you do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>not send one of your ministers to
accompany me.&rdquo; Thereupon the tsar appointed as his companion for
the voyage, the very minister to whom he had formerly promised his
daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s father was greatly surprised to see his son
return so soon and in such a magnificent ship. Then the young man
related to his father and others all that had happened, and the
imperial minister confirmed all his statements. When the princess saw
the minister she exclaimed joyfully: &ldquo;Yes, indeed, all that he
has said is true; this is my father&rsquo;s minister, who was to be my
betrothed.&rdquo; Then the man and his family sold all their property
and went on board the ship.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e5901">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5902" class="main">The Treacherous Minister</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now the minister was a wicked man, and he had formed a
design to kill the young husband of the princess that he might espouse
her and one day become tsar. Accordingly during the voyage he called
the young man on deck one night to confer with him. The captain had a
quiet conscience and did not suspect evil, wherefore he was entirely
unprepared when the minister seized him and threw him swiftly
overboard. The ship was sailing fast; it was impossible that he could
reach it, so he fell gradually behind. By great good luck he was very
near to land and soon he was cast ashore by the waves. But, alas! this
land was but a bare uninhabited rock.</p>
<p>Meantime the minister had stolen back to his cabin and next morning
when it was found that the captain had disappeared, all began to weep
and wail, thinking that he had fallen overboard in the night and been
drowned. His family would not be consoled, more especially his wife,
who loved him so much. When they arrived at the tsar&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>palace and reported that the young man had been
accidentally drowned, the entire court mourned with them.</p>
<p>For fifteen days the tsar&rsquo;s unhappy son-in-law was condemned
to a bare subsistence upon the scanty grass which grew upon the rocky
islet. His skin was tanned by the hot sun and his garments became
soiled and torn, so that no one could have recognized him. On the
morrow of the fifteenth day, he had the good fortune to perceive an old
man on the shore, leaning on a stick, engaged in fishing. He began at
once to hail the old man and to beseech him to help him off the rock.
The old fisherman said: &ldquo;I will save you, if you will pay
me!&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I pay you,&rdquo; answered the castaway,
&ldquo;when, as you see, I have only these rags, and nothing
more?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; replied the old man,
&ldquo;you can write and sign a promise to give me a half of everything
that you may ever possess.&rdquo; The young man gladly made this
promise. Then the old man produced writing materials and the young man
signed the agreement, after which they both sailed in the old
man&rsquo;s fishing boat to the mainland. After that the young man
wandered from house to house and from village to village, a barefoot
beggar, in rags, sunburnt, and hungry.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5913" class="main">The Young Man&rsquo;s Return</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After thirty days&rsquo; journeying, good luck led him
to the city of the tsar and he sat him down, staff in hand, at the
gates of the palace, still wearing on his finger his wedding-ring, on
which was engraved his name and that of his wife. The servants of the
tsar, pitying his sad plight, offered him shelter for the night in the
palace and gave him to eat fragments from their own dinner. Next
morning he went to the garden of the palace, but the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>gardener came and drove him away, saying that
the tsar and his family were soon coming by. He moved from that spot
and sat down in a corner on the grass, when suddenly he saw the tsar
walking with his own mother and father, who had remained at the court
as the tsar&rsquo;s guests, and his beloved wife walking arm in arm
with his enemy, the minister. He did not yet wish to reveal himself,
but as the tsar and his train passed by and gave him alms, he stretched
out his hand to receive it and the wedding-ring upon his finger caught
the princess&rsquo;s eye. She recognized it at once, but it was
incredible that the beggar could be her husband, and she said to him:
&ldquo;Pray, give me your hand that I may see your ring!&rdquo; The
minister protested, but the princess did not pay any attention to him,
and proceeded to examine the ring, to find there her own name and that
of her husband. Her heart was greatly agitated at the sight, but she
made an effort to control her feelings and said nothing. Upon her
return to the palace she appeared before her father and told him what
she had seen. &ldquo;Please send for him,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
we may find out how the ring came into his possession!&rdquo; The tsar
immediately sent an attendant to fetch the beggar. The order was
executed at once, and, when the stranger appeared the tsar asked him
his name, whence he came, and in what manner he obtained the ring. The
unfortunate young man could no longer maintain his disguise, so telling
the tsar who he was, he went on to relate all his adventures since the
minister treacherously threw him into the sea. &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo;
said he at last, &ldquo;Our gracious Lord and my right-dealing has
brought me back to my parents and my wife.&rdquo; Almost beside
themselves for joy, the tsar called for the young man&rsquo;s parents
and imparted to them the good news. Who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>could express the joy
of the aged couple when they identified their son? Words fail, also, to
describe adequately the rejoicing which filled the hearts of the entire
court.<a id="xd19e5921" name="xd19e5921"></a> The servants prepared
perfumed baths for the young man and brought him sumptuous new
garments. The tsar gave orders that he should be crowned as tsar, and
for several days there were wonderful festivities, in which the whole
city joined; everywhere was singing, dancing and feasting. The old tsar
summoned the wicked minister to appear before his son-in-law, to be
dealt with according to his will. But the young tsar had a kind heart,
so he forgave him upon the condition that he should leave the tsardom
without delay, and never come back during his reign.</p>

</div>
<p>The new tsar had hardly began to rule, when the old fisherman who
had saved him from the rocky isle came and craved audience. The tsar at
once received his deliverer who produced the written promise.
&ldquo;Very well, old man,&rdquo; said the tsar; &ldquo;to-day I am
ruler, but I will as readily fulfil my word as if I were a beggar with
little to share; so let us divide my possessions in two equal
parts.&rdquo; Then the tsar took the books and began to divide the
cities, saying: &ldquo;This is for you&mdash;this is for me.&rdquo; So
he marked all on a map, till the whole tsardom was divided between
them, from the greatest city to the poorest hut.</p>
<p>When the tsar had finished the old man said: &ldquo;Take all back! I
am not a man of this world; I am an angel from God, who sent me to save
you on account of your good deeds. Now reign and be happy, and may you
live long in complete prosperity!&rdquo; So saying, he vanished
suddenly, and the young tsar ruled in great happiness ever after.

told them to go to the neighbouring town and seek for employment.
&ldquo;He who brings me the finest rug will obtain my permission to
marry first,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The brothers started off to the neighbouring town together. On the
way the two elder brothers began to make fun of the youngest, mocking
his simplicity, and finally they forced him to take a different
road.</p>
<p>Abandoned by his malicious brothers, the young man prayed God to
grant him good fortune. At length he came to a lake, on the further
shore of which was a magnificent castle. The castle belonged to the
daughter of a tyrannous and cruel prince who had died long ago. The
young princess was uncommonly beautiful, and many a suitor had come
there to ask for her hand. The suitors were always made very welcome,
but when they went to their rooms at night the late master of the
castle would invariably come as a vampire and suffocate them.</p>
<p>As the youngest brother stood upon the shore wondering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>how
to cross the lake, the princess noticed him from her window and at once
gave an order to the servants to take a boat and bring the young man
before her. When he appeared he was a little confused, but the noble
maiden reassured him with some kind words&mdash;for he had, indeed,
made a good impression upon her and she liked him at first sight. She
asked him whence he came and where he intended to go, and the young man
told her all about his father&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>When the princess heard that, she said to the young man: &ldquo;You
will remain here for the night, and to-morrow morning we will see what
we can do about your rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had supped, the princess conducted her guest to a green
room, and bidding him &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; said: &ldquo;This is
your room. Do not be alarmed if during the night anything unusual
should appear to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being a simple youth, he could not even close his eyes, so deep was
the impression made by the beautiful things which surrounded him, when
suddenly, toward midnight, there was a great noise. In the midst of the
commotion he heard distinctly a mysterious voice whisper: &ldquo;This
youth will inherit the princely crown, no one can do him harm!&rdquo;
The young man took refuge in earnest prayer, and, when day dawned, he
arose safe and sound.</p>
<p>When the princess awoke, she sent a servant to summon the young man
to her presence, and he was greatly astonished to find the young man
alive; so also was the princess and every one in the castle.</p>
<p>After breakfast the princess gave her guest a rich rug, saying:
&ldquo;Take this rug to your father, and if he desires aught else you
have only to come back.&rdquo; The young man thanked his fair hostess
and with a deep bow took his leave of her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he arrived home he found his two brothers already there; they
were showing their father the rugs they had brought. When the youngest
exhibited his they were astounded, and exclaimed: &ldquo;How did you
get hold of such a costly rug? You must have stolen it!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="xd19e5969" class="main">The Second Quest</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At length the father, in order to quieten them, said:
&ldquo;Go once more into the world, and he who brings back a chain long
enough to encircle our house nine times shall have my permission to
marry first!&rdquo; Thus the father succeeded in pacifying his sons.
The two elder brothers went their way, and the youngest hurried back to
the princess. When he appeared she asked him: &ldquo;What has your
father ordered you to do now?&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;That each
of us should bring a chain long enough to encircle our house nine
times.&rdquo; The princess again made him welcome and, after supper,
she showed him into a yellow room, saying: &ldquo;Somebody will come
again to frighten you during the night, but you must not pay any
attention to him, and to-morrow we will see what we can do about your
chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough, about midnight there came many ghosts dancing round
his bed and making fearful noises, but he followed the advice of the
princess and remained calm and quiet. Next morning a servant came once
more to conduct him to the princess, and, after breakfast, she gave him
a fine box, saying: &ldquo;Take this to your father, and if he should
desire anything more, you have but to come to me.&rdquo; The young man
thanked her, and took his leave.</p>
<p>Again he found that his brothers had reached home first with their
chains, but these were not long enough to encircle the house even once,
and they were greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>astonished when their youngest
brother produced from the box the princess had given an enormous gold
chain of the required length. Filled with envy, they exclaimed:
&ldquo;You will ruin the reputation of our house, for you must have
stolen this chain!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e5980" class="main">The Third Quest</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At length the father, tired of their jangling, sent
them away, saying: &ldquo;Go; bring each of you his sweetheart, and I
will give you permission to marry.&rdquo; Thereupon the two elder
brothers went joyfully to fetch the girls they loved, and the youngest
hurried away to the princess to tell her what was now his
father&rsquo;s desire. When she heard, the princess said: &ldquo;You
must pass a third night here, and then we shall see what we can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after supping together, she took him into a red room. During the
night he heard again a blood-curdling noise, and from the darkness a
mysterious voice said: &ldquo;This young man is about to take
possession of my estates and crown!&rdquo; He was assaulted by ghosts
and vampires, and was dragged from his bed; but through all the young
man strove earnestly in prayer, and God saved him.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5987width" id="p302"><img src="images/p302.jpg"
alt="The young man strove earnestly in prayer" width="495" height=

<p class="figureHead">The young man strove earnestly in prayer</p>
</div>
<p>Next morning when he appeared before the princess, she congratulated
him on his bravery, and declared that he had won her love. The young
man was overwhelmed with happiness, for although he would never have
dared to reveal the secret of his heart, he also loved the princess. A
barber was now summoned to attend upon the young man, and a tailor to
dress him like a prince. This done, the couple went together to the
castle chapel and were wedded.</p>
<p>A few days later they drove to the young man&rsquo;s village, and as
they stopped outside his home they heard great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>rejoicing and music, whereat they understood
that his two elder brothers were celebrating their marriage feasts. The
youngest brother knocked on the gate, and when his father came he did
not recognize his son in the richly attired prince who stood before
him. He was surprised that such distinguished guests should pay him a
visit, and still more so when the prince said: &ldquo;Good man, will
you give us your hospitality for to-night?&rdquo; The father answered:
&ldquo;Most gladly, but we are having festivities in our house, and I
fear that these common people will disturb you with their singing and
music.&rdquo; To this the young prince said: &ldquo;Oh, no; it would
please me to see the peasants feasting, and my wife would like it even
more than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They now entered the house, and as the hostess curtsied deeply
before them the prince congratulated her, saying: &ldquo;How happy you
must be to see your two sons wedded on the same day!&rdquo; The woman
sighed. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;on one hand I have joy and
on the other mourning: I had a third son, who went out in the world,
and who knows what ill fate may have befallen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a time the young prince found an opportunity to step into his
old room, and put on one of his old suits over his costly attire. He
then returned to the room where the feast was spread and stood behind
the door. Soon his two brothers saw him, and they called out:
&ldquo;Come here, father, and see your much-praised son, who went and
stole like a thief!&rdquo; The father turned, and seeing the young man,
he exclaimed: &ldquo;Where have you been for so long, and where is your
sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the youngest son said: &ldquo;Do not reproach me; all is well
with me and with you!&rdquo; As he spake he took off his old garments
and stood revealed in his princely dress. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>Then he told his
story and introduced his wife to his parents.</p>
<p>The brothers now expressed contrition for their conduct, and
received the prince&rsquo;s pardon, after which they all embraced; the
feasting was renewed, and the festivities went on for several days.
Finally the young prince distributed amongst his father and brothers
large portions of his new lands, and they all lived long and happily
together.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, a long while ago, there lived in a
very far-off country, a young nobleman who was so exceedingly poor that
all his property was an old castle, a handsome horse, a trusty hound,
and a good rifle.</p>
<p>This nobleman spent all his time in hunting and shooting, and lived
entirely on the produce of the chase.</p>
<p>One day he mounted his well-kept horse and rode off to the
neighbouring forest, accompanied, as usual, by his faithful hound. When
he came to the forest he dismounted, fastened his horse securely to a
young tree, and then went deep into the thicket in search of game. The
hound ran on at a distance before his master, and the horse remained
all alone, grazing quietly. Now it happened that a hungry fox came by
that way and, seeing how well-fed and well-trimmed the horse was,
stopped a while to admire him. By and by she was so charmed with the
handsome horse, that she lay down in the grass near him to bear him
company.</p>
<p>Some time afterward the young nobleman came back out of the forest,
carrying a stag that he had killed, and was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>extremely surprised to see the fox lying so near
his horse. So he raised his rifle with the intention of shooting her;
but the fox ran up to him quickly and said, &ldquo;Do not kill me! Take
me with you, and I will serve you faithfully. I will take care of your
fine horse whilst you are in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox spoke so pitifully that the nobleman was sorry for her, and
agreed to her proposal. Thereupon he mounted his horse, placed the stag
he had shot before him, and rode back to his old castle, followed
closely by his hound and his new servant, the fox.</p>
<p>When the young nobleman prepared his supper, he did not forget to
give the fox a due share, and she congratulated herself that she was
never likely to be hungry again, at least so long as she served so
skilful a hunter.</p>
<p>The next morning the nobleman went out again to the chase; the fox
also accompanied him. When the young man dismounted and bound his
horse, as usual, to a tree, the fox lay down near it to keep it
company.</p>
<p>Now, whilst the hunter was far off in the depth of the forest
looking for game, a hungry bear came by the place where the horse was
tied, and, seeing how invitingly fat it looked, ran up to kill it. The
fox hereupon sprang up and begged the bear not to hurt the horse,
telling him if he was hungry he had only to wait patiently until her
master came back from the forest, and then she was quite sure that the
good nobleman would take him also to his castle and feed him, and care
for him, as he did for his horse, his hound, and herself.</p>
<p>The bear pondered over the matter very wisely and deeply for some
time, and at length resolved to follow the fox&rsquo;s advice.
Accordingly he lay down quietly near the horse, and waited for the
return of the huntsman. When the young noble came out of the forest he
was greatly surprised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>to see so large a bear near his
horse, and, dropping the stag he had shot from his shoulders, he raised
his trusty rifle and was about to shoot the beast. The fox, however,
ran up to the huntsman and entreated him to spare the bear&rsquo;s
life, and to take him, also, into his service. This the nobleman agreed
to do; and, mounting his horse, rode back to his castle, followed by
the hound, the fox, and the bear.</p>
<p>The next morning, when the young man had gone again with his dog
into the forest, and the fox and the bear lay quietly near the horse, a
hungry wolf, seeing the horse, sprang out of a thicket to kill it. The
fox and the bear, however, jumped up quickly and begged him not to hurt
the animal, telling him to what a good master it belonged, and that
they were sure, if he would only wait, he also would be taken into the
same service, and would be well cared for. Thereupon the wolf, hungry
though he was, thought it best to accept their counsel, and he also lay
down with them in the grass until their master come out of the
forest.</p>
<p>You can imagine how surprised the young nobleman was when he saw a
great gaunt wolf lying so near his horse! However, when the fox had
explained the matter to him, he consented to take the wolf also into
his service. Thus it happened that this day he rode home followed by
the dog, the fox, the bear, and the wolf. As they were all hungry, the
stag he had killed was not too large to furnish their suppers that
night, and their breakfasts next morning. Not many days afterward a
mouse was added to the company, and after that a mole begged so hard
for admission that the good nobleman could not find in his heart to
refuse her. Last of all came the great bird, the kumrekusha&mdash;so
strong a bird that she can carry in her claws a horse with his rider!
Soon after a hare was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>added to the company, and the
nobleman took great care of all his animals and fed them regularly and
well, so that they were all exceedingly fond of him.</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6044">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6045" class="main">The Animals&rsquo; Council</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day the fox said to the bear, &ldquo;My good
Bruin, pray run into the forest and bring me a nice large log, on which
I can sit whilst I preside at a very important council we are going to
hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruin, who had a great respect for the quick wit and good management
of the fox, went out at once to seek the log, and soon came back
bringing a heavy one, with which the fox expressed herself quite
satisfied. Then she called all the animals about her, and, having
mounted the log, addressed them in these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know all of you, my friends, how very kind and good a
master we have. But, though he is very kind, he is also very lonely. I
propose, therefore, that we find a fitting wife for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembly was evidently well pleased with this idea, and
responded unanimously, &ldquo;Very good, indeed, if we only knew any
girl worthy to be the wife of our master; which, however, we do
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the fox said, &ldquo;<i>I</i> know that the king has a most
beautiful daughter, and I think it will be a good thing to take her for
our lord; and therefore I propose, further, that our friend the
kumrekusha should fly at once to the king&rsquo;s palace, and hover
about there until the princess comes out to take her walk. Then she
must catch her up at once, and bring her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the kumrekusha was glad to do anything for her kind master, she
flew away at once, without even waiting to hear the decision of the
assembly on this proposal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just before evening set in, the princess came out to walk before her
father&rsquo;s palace: whereupon the great bird seized her and placed
her gently on her outspread wings, and thus carried her off swiftly to
the young nobleman&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>The king was exceedingly grieved when he heard that his daughter had
been carried off, and sent out everywhere proclamations promising rich
rewards to any one who should bring her back, or even tell him where he
might look for her. For a long time, however, all his promises were of
no avail, for no one in the kingdom knew anything at all about the
princess.</p>
<p>At last, however, when the king was well-nigh in despair, an old
gipsy woman came to the palace and asked the king, &ldquo;What will you
give me if I bring back to you your daughter, the princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king answered quickly, &ldquo;I will gladly give you whatever
you like to ask, if only you bring me back my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old gipsy went back to her hut in the forest, and tried all
her magical spells to find out where the princess was. At last she
found out that she was living in an old castle, in a very distant
country, with a young nobleman who had married her.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6074">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6075" class="main">The Magic Carpet</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The gipsy was greatly pleased when she knew this, and
taking a whip in her hand seated herself at once in the middle of a
small carpet, and lashed it with her whip. Then the carpet rose up from
the ground and bore her swiftly through the air, toward the far country
where the young nobleman lived, in his lonely old castle, with his
beautiful wife, and all his faithful company of beasts. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the gipsy came near the castle she made the carpet descend on
the grass among some tress, and leaving it there went to look about
until she could meet the princess walking about the grounds. By and by
the beautiful young lady came out of the castle, and immediately the
ugly old woman went up to her, and began to fawn on her and to tell her
all kinds of strange stories. Indeed, she was such a good story-teller
that the princess grew quite tired of walking before she was tired of
listening; so, seeing the soft carpet lying nicely on the green grass,
she sat down on it to rest awhile. The moment she was seated the
cunning old gipsy sat down by her, and, seizing her whip, lashed the
carpet furiously. In the next minute the princess found herself borne
upon the carpet far away from her husband&rsquo;s castle, and before
long the gipsy made it descend into the garden of the king&rsquo;s
palace.</p>
<p>You can easily guess how glad he was to see his lost daughter, and
how he generously gave the gipsy even more than she asked as a reward.
Then the king made the princess live from that time in a very secluded
tower with only two waiting-women, so afraid was he lest she would
again be stolen from him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the fox, seeing how miserable and melancholy her young
master appeared after his wife had so strangely been taken from him,
and having heard of the great precautions which the king was using in
order to prevent the princess being carried off again, summoned once
more all the animals to a general council.</p>
<p>When all of them were gathered about her, the fox thus began:
&ldquo;You know all of you, my dear friends, how happily our kind
master was married; but you know, also, that his wife has been
unhappily stolen from him, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>he is now far worse
off than he was before we found the princess for him. <i>Then</i> he
was lonely; <i>now</i> he is more than lonely&mdash;he is desolate!
This being the case, it is clearly our duty, as his faithful servants,
to try in some way to bring her back to him. This, however, is not a
very easy matter, seeing that the king has placed his daughter for
safety in a strong tower. Nevertheless, I do not despair, and my plan
is this: I will turn myself into a beautiful cat, and play about in the
palace gardens under the windows of the tower in which the princess
lives. I dare say she will long for me greatly the moment she sees me,
and will send her waiting-women down to catch me and take me up to her.
But I will take good care that the maids do not catch me, so that, at
last, the princess will forget her father&rsquo;s orders not to leave
the tower, and will come down herself into the gardens to see if she
may not be more successful. I will then make believe to let her catch
me, and at this moment our friend, the kumrekusha, who must be hovering
over about the palace, must fly down quickly, seize the princess, and
carry her off as before. In this way, my dear friends, I hope we shall
be able to bring back to our kind master his beautiful wife. Do you
approve of my plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the assembly were only too glad to have such a wise
counsellor, and to be able to prove their gratitude to their
considerate master. So the fox ran up to the kumrekusha, who flew away
with her under her wing, both being equally eager to carry out the
project, and thus to bring back the old cheerful look to the face of
their lord.</p>
<p>When the kumrekusha came to the tower wherein the princess dwelt she
set the fox down quietly among the trees, where it at once changed into
a most beautiful cat, and commenced to play all sorts of graceful
antics under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>the window at which the princess sat. The cat
was striped all over the body with many different colours, and before
long the king&rsquo;s daughter noticed her, and sent down her two women
to catch her and bring her up in the tower.</p>
<p>The two waiting-women came down into the garden, and called,
&ldquo;Pussy! pussy!&rdquo; in their sweetest voices; they offered her
bread and milk, but they offered it all in vain. The cat sprang merrily
about the garden, and ran round and round them, but would on no account
consent to be caught.</p>
<p>At length the princess, who stood watching them at one of the
windows of her tower, became impatient, and descended herself into the
garden, saying petulantly, &ldquo;You only frighten the cat; let me try
to catch her!&rdquo; As she approached the cat, who seemed now willing
to be caught, the kumrekusha darted down quickly, seized the princess
by the waist, and carried her high up into the air.</p>
<p>The frightened waiting-women ran to report to the king what had
happened to the princess; whereupon the king immediately let loose all
his greyhounds to seize the cat which had been the cause of his
daughter&rsquo;s being carried off a second time. The dogs followed the
cat closely, and were on the point of catching her, when she, just in
the nick of time, saw a cave with a very narrow entrance and ran into
it for shelter. There the dogs tried to follow her, or to widen the
mouth of the cave with their claws, but all in vain; so, after barking
a long time very furiously, they at length grew weary, and stole back
ashamed and afraid to the king&rsquo;s stables.</p>
<p>When all the greyhounds were out of sight the cat changed herself
back into a fox, and ran off in a straight line toward the castle,
where she found her young master <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>very joyful, for the
kumrekusha had already brought back to him his beautiful wife.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6113">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6114" class="main">The King makes War on the Animals</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now the king was exceedingly angry to think that he
had again lost his daughter, and he was all the more angry to think
that such poor creatures as a bird and a cat had succeeded in carrying
her off after all his precautions. So, in his great wrath, he resolved
to make a general war on the animals, and entirely exterminate
them.</p>
<p>To this end he gathered together a very large army, and determined
to be himself their leader. The news of the king&rsquo;s intention
spread swiftly over the whole kingdom, whereupon for the third time the
fox called together all her friends&mdash;the bear, the wolf, the
kumrekusha, the mouse, the mole, and the hare&mdash;to a general
council.</p>
<p>When all were assembled the fox addressed them thus: &ldquo;My
friends, the king has declared war against us, and intends to destroy
us all. Now it is our duty to defend ourselves in the best way we can.
Let us each see what number of animals we are able to muster. How many
of your brother bears do you think <i>you</i> can bring to our help, my
good Bruin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear got up as quickly as he could on his hind legs and called
out, &ldquo;I am sure I can bring a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many of your friends can <i>you</i> bring, my good
wolf?&rdquo; asked the fox anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bring at least five hundred wolves with me,&rdquo; said
the wolf with an air of importance.</p>
<p>The fox nodded her satisfaction and continued, &ldquo;And what can
<i>you</i> do for us, dear master hare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think, I can bring about eight hundred,&rdquo; said
the hare cautiously. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what can <i>you</i> do, you dear little mouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> can certainly bring three thousand
mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, indeed!&mdash;and you Mr. Mole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I can gather eight thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what number do you think you can bring us, my great
friend, kumrekusha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not more than two or three hundred, at the very
best,&rdquo; said the kumrekusha sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; now all of you go at once and collect your
friends; when you have brought all you can, we will decide what is to
be done,&rdquo; said the fox; whereupon the council broke up, and the
animals dispersed in different directions throughout the forest.</p>
<p>Not very long after, very unusual noises were heard in the
neighbourhood of the castle. There was a great shaking of trees; and
the growling of bears and the short sharp barking of wolves broke the
usual quiet of the forest. The army of animals was gathering from all
sides at the appointed place. When all were gathered together the fox
explained to them her plans in these words: &ldquo;When the
king&rsquo;s army stops on its march to rest the first night, then you,
bears and wolves, must be prepared to attack and kill all the horses.
If, notwithstanding this, the army proceeds farther, you mice must be
ready to bite and destroy all the saddle-straps and belts while the
soldiers are resting the second night, and you hares must gnaw through
the ropes with which the men draw the cannon. If the king still
persists in his march, you moles must go the third night and dig out
the earth under the road they will take the next day, and must make a
ditch full fifteen yards in breadth and twenty yards in depth all round
their camp. Next morning, when the army begins to march over this
ground which has been hollowed out, you kumrekushas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>must
throw down on them from above heavy stones while the earth will give
way under them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was approved, and all the animals went off briskly to
attend to their allotted duties.</p>
<p>When the king&rsquo;s army awoke, after their first night&rsquo;s
rest on their march, they beheld, to their great consternation, that
all the horses were killed. This sad news was reported at once to the
king; but he only sent back for more horses, and, when they came late
in the day, pursued his march.</p>
<p>The second night the mice crept quietly into the camp, and nibbled
diligently at the horses&rsquo; saddles and at the soldiers&rsquo;
belts, while the hares as busily gnawed at the ropes with which the men
drew the cannon.</p>
<p>Next morning the soldiers were terrified, seeing the mischief the
animals had done. The king, however, reassured them, and sent back to
the city for new saddles and belts. When they were at length brought he
resolutely pursued his march, only the more determined to revenge
himself on these presumptuous and despised enemies.</p>
<p>On the third night, while the soldiers were sleeping, the moles
worked incessantly in digging round the camp a wide and deep trench
underground. About midnight the fox sent the bears to help the moles,
and to carry away the loads of earth.</p>
<p>Next morning the king&rsquo;s soldiers were delighted to find that
no harm seemed to have been done on the previous night to their horses
or straps, and started with new courage on their march. But their march
was quickly arrested, for soon the heavy horsemen and artillery began
to fall through the hollow ground, and the king, when he observed that,
called out, &ldquo;Let us turn back. I see God himself is against us,
since we have declared war against the animals. I will give up my
daughter.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the army turned back, amidst the rejoicings of the soldiers.
The men found, however, to their great surprise and fear, that
whichever way they turned, they fell through the earth. To make their
consternation yet more complete, the kumrekushas now began to throw
down heavy stones on them, which crushed them completely. In this way
the king, as well as his whole army, perished.</p>
<p>Very soon afterward the young nobleman, who had married the
king&rsquo;s daughter, went to the enemy&rsquo;s capital and took
possession of the king&rsquo;s palace, taking with him all his animals;
and there they all lived long and happily together.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6186" class="main">XVI. The Three Suitors</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a very remote country there formerly lived a king
who had only one child&mdash;an exceedingly beautiful daughter. The
princess had a great number of suitors, and amongst them were three
young noblemen, whom the king loved much. As, however, the king liked
the three nobles equally well, he could not decide to which of the
three he should give his daughter as wife. One day, therefore, he
called the three young noblemen to him, and said, &ldquo;Go, all of
you, and travel about the world. The one of you who brings home the
most remarkable thing shall be my son-in-law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three suitors started at once on their travels, each of them
taking opposite ways, and going in search of remarkable things into far
different countries.</p>
<p>A long time had not passed before one of the young nobles found a
wonderful carpet which would carry rapidly through the air whoever sat
upon it.</p>
<p>Another of them found a marvellous telescope, through which he could
see everybody and everything in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>world, and even the
many-coloured sands at the bottom of the great deep sea.</p>
<p>The third found a wonder-working ointment, which could cure every
disease in the world, and even bring dead people back to life
again.</p>
<p>Now the three noble travellers were far distant from each other when
they found these wonderful things. But when the young man who had found
the telescope looked through it, he saw one of his former friends and
present rivals walking with a carpet on his shoulder, and so he set out
to join him. As he could always see, by means of his marvellous
telescope, where the other nobleman was, he had no great difficulty in
finding him, and when the two had met, they sat side by side on the
wonderful carpet, and it carried them through the air until they had
joined the third traveller. One day, when each of them had been telling
of the remarkable things he had seen in his travels, one of them
exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;Now let us see what the beautiful princess
is doing, and where she is.&rdquo; Then the noble who had found the
telescope, looked through it and saw, to his great surprise and dismay,
that the king&rsquo;s daughter was lying very sick and at the point of
death. He told this to his two friends and rivals, and they, too, were
thunderstruck at the bad news&mdash;until the one who had found the
wonder-working ointment, remembering it suddenly, exclaimed, &ldquo;I
am sure I could cure her, if I could only reach the palace soon
enough!&rdquo; On hearing this the noble who had found the wonderful
carpet cried out, &ldquo;Let us sit down on my carpet, and it will
quickly carry us to the king&rsquo;s palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the three nobles gently placed themselves in the carpet,
which rose instantly in the air, and carried them direct to the
king&rsquo;s palace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318"
name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king received them immediately; but said very sadly, &ldquo;I am
sorry for you: for all your travels have been in vain. My daughter is
just dying, so she can marry none of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the nobleman who possessed the wonder-working ointment said
respectfully, &ldquo;Do not fear, sire, the princess will not
die!&rdquo; And on being permitted to enter the apartment where she lay
sick, he placed the ointment so that she could smell it. In a few
moments the princess revived, and when her waiting-women had rubbed a
little of the ointment in her skin she recovered so quickly that in a
few days she was better than she had been before she was taken ill.</p>
<p>The king was so glad to have his daughter given back to him, as he
thought, from the grave, that he declared that she should marry no one
but the young nobleman whose wonderful ointment had cured her.</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6212">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6213" class="main">The Dispute</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But now a great dispute arose between the three young
nobles: the one who possessed the ointment affirmed that had he not
found it the princess would have died, and could not, therefore, have
married any one; the noble who owned the telescope declared that had he
not found the wonderful telescope they would never have known that the
princess was dying, and so his friend would not have brought the
ointment to cure her; whilst the third noble proved to them that had he
not found the wonderful carpet neither the finding of the ointment nor
the telescope would have helped the princess, since they could not have
travelled such a great distance in time to save her.</p>
<p>The king, overhearing this dispute, called the young noblemen to
him, and said to them, &ldquo;My lords, from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>what
you have said, I see that I cannot, with justice, give my daughter to
any of you; therefore, I pray you to give up altogether the idea of
marrying her, and that you continue friends as you always were before
you became rivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three young nobles saw that the king had decided justly; so they
all left their native country, and went into a far-off desert to live
like hermits. And the king gave the princess to another of his great
nobles.</p>
<p>Many, many years had passed away since the marriage of the princess,
when her husband was sent by her father to a distant country with which
the king was waging war. The nobleman took his wife, the princess, with
him, as he was uncertain how long he might be forced to remain abroad.
Now it happened that a violent storm arose just as the vessel which
carried the princess and her husband was approaching a strange coast;
and in the height of the great tempest the ship dashed on some rocks,
and went to pieces instantly. All the people on board perished in the
waves, excepting only the princess, who clung very fast to a boat and
was carried by the wind and the tide to the shore. There she found what
seemed to be an uninhabited country, and, discovering a small cave in a
rock, she lived alone in it for three years, feeding on wild herbs and
fruits. She searched every day to find some way out of the forest which
surrounded her cave, but could find none. One day, however, when she
had wandered farther than usual from the cave where she lived, she came
suddenly on another cave which, to her great astonishment, had a small
door. She tried over and over again to open the door, thinking she
would pass the night in the cave; but all her efforts were unavailing,
it was shut so fast. At length, however, a deep voice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>from
within the cave called out, &ldquo;Who is at the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the princess was so surprised that she could not answer for
some moments; when, however, she had recovered a little, she said,
&ldquo;Open me the door!&rdquo; Immediately the door was opened from
within, and she saw, with sudden terror, an old man with a thick grey
beard reaching below his waist and long white hair flowing over his
shoulders.</p>
<p>What frightened the princess the more was her finding a man living
here in the same desert where she had lived herself three years without
seeing a single soul.</p>
<p>The hermit and the princess looked at each long and earnestly
without saying a word. At length, however, the old man said,
&ldquo;Tell me, are you an angel or a daughter of this
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the princess answered, &ldquo;Old man, let me rest a moment,
and then I will tell you all about myself, and what brought me
here.&rdquo; So the hermit brought out some wild pears, and when the
princess had taken some of them, she began to tell him who she was, and
how she came in that desert. She said, &ldquo;I am a king&rsquo;s
daughter, and once, many years ago, three young nobles of my
father&rsquo;s court asked the king for my hand in marriage. Now the
king had such an equal affection for all these three young men that he
was unwilling to give pain to any of them, so he sent them to travel
into distant countries, and promised to decide between them when they
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three noblemen remained a long time away; and whilst they
were still abroad somewhere, I fell dangerously ill. I was just at the
point of death, when they all three returned suddenly; one of them
bringing a wonderful ointment, which cured me at once; the two others
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>brought each equally remarkable things&mdash;a
carpet that would carry whoever sat on it through the air, and a
telescope with which one could see everybody and everything in the
world, even to the sands at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6239">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6240" class="main">The Recognition</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The princess had gone on thus far with her story, when
the hermit suddenly interrupted her, saying: &ldquo;All that happened
afterward I know as well as you can tell me. Look at me, my daughter! I
am one of those noblemen who sought to win your hand, and here is the
wonderful telescope.&rdquo; And the hermit brought out the instrument
from a recess in the side of his cave before he continued; &ldquo;My
two friends and rivals came with me to this desert. We parted, however,
immediately, and have never met since. I know not whether they are
living or dead, but I will look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the hermit looked through his telescope, and saw that the other
two noblemen were living in caves like his, in different parts of the
same desert. Having found this out, he took the princess by the hand,
and led her on until they found the other hermits. When all were
re-united, the princess related her adventures since the foundering of
the ship, in which her husband had gone down, and from which she alone
had been saved.</p>
<p>The three noble hermits were pleased to see her alive once again,
but at once decided that they ought to send her back to the king, her
father.</p>
<p>Then they made the princess a present of the wonderful telescope,
and the wonder-working ointment, and placed her on the wonderful
carpet, which carried her and her treasures quickly and safely to her
father&rsquo;s palace. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>for the three noblemen, they
remained, still living like hermits, in the desert, only they visited
each other now and then, so that the years seemed no longer so tedious
to them. For they had many adventures to relate to each other.</p>
<p>The king was exceedingly glad to receive his only child back safely,
and the princess lived with her father many years; but neither the king
nor his daughter could entirely forget the three noble friends who, for
her sake, lived like hermits in a wild desert in a far-off land.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6255" class="main">XVII. The Dream of the King&rsquo;s
Son</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king who had three sons. One evening,
when the young princes were going to sleep, the king ordered them to
take good note of their dreams and come and tell them to him next
morning. So, the next day the princes went to their father as soon as
they awoke, and the moment the king saw them he asked of the eldest,
&ldquo;Well, what have you dreamt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince answered, &ldquo;I dreamt that I should be the heir to
your throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the second said, &ldquo;And I dreamt that I should be the first
subject in the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the youngest said, &ldquo;<i>I</i> dreamt that I was going to
wash my hands, and that the princes, my brothers, held the basin,
whilst the queen, my mother, held fine towels for me to dry my hands
with, and your majesty&rsquo;s self poured water over them from a
golden ewer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, hearing this last dream, became very angry, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;What! I&mdash;the king&mdash;pour water over the hands of my own
son! Go away this instant out of my palace, and out of my kingdom! You
are no longer my son.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poor young prince tried hard to make his peace with his father,
saying that he was really not to be blamed for what he had only
dreamed; but the king grew more and more furious, and at last actually
thrust the prince out of the palace.</p>
<p>So the young prince was obliged to wander up and down in different
countries, until one day, being in a large forest, he saw a cave, and
entered it to rest. There, to his great surprise and joy, he found a
large kettle full of Indian corn, boiling over a fire: and, being
exceedingly hungry, began to help himself to the corn. In this way he
went until he was shocked to see he had nearly eaten up all the maize,
and then, being afraid some mischief would come of it, he looked about
for a place in which to hide himself. At this moment, however, a great
noise was heard at the cave-mouth, and he had only time to hide himself
in a dark corner before a blind old man entered, riding on a great goat
and driving a number of goats before him.</p>
<p>The old man rode straight up to the kettle, but as soon as he found
that the corn was nearly all gone, he began to suspect some one was
there, and groped about the cave until he caught hold of the
prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked he sharply; and the prince
answered, &ldquo;I am a poor, homeless wanderer about the world, and
have come now to beg you to be good enough to receive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;why not? I shall at
least have some one to mind my corn whilst I am out with my goats in
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they lived together for some time; the prince remaining in the
cave to boil the maize, whilst the old man drove out his goats every
morning into the forest.</p>
<p>One day, however, the old man said to the prince, &ldquo;I think
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>you shall take out the goats to-day, and I will
stay at home to mind the corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the prince consented to very gladly, as he was tired of living
so long quietly in the cave. But the old man added, &ldquo;Mind only
one thing! There are nine different mountains, and you can let the
goats go freely over eight of them, but you must on no account go on
the ninth. The veele live there, and they will certainly put out your
eyes as they have put out mine, if you venture on their
mountain.&rdquo; The prince thanked the old man for his warning, and
then, mounting the great goat, drove the rest of the goats before him
out of the cave.</p>
<p>Following the goats, he had passed over all the mountains to the
eighth, and from this he could see the ninth mountain, and could not
resist the temptation he felt to go upon it. So he said to himself,
&ldquo;I will venture up, whatever happens!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6292">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6293" class="main">The Prince and the Veele</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hardly had he stepped on the ninth mountain before the
fairies surrounded him, and prepared to put out his eyes. But, happily,
a thought came into his head, and he exclaimed, quickly, &ldquo;Dear
veele, why take this sin on your heads? Better let us make a bargain,
that if you spring over a tree that I will place ready to jump over,
you shall put out my eyes, and I will not blame you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the veele consented to this, and the prince went and brought a
large tree, which he cleft down the middle almost to the root; this
done, he placed a wedge to keep the two halves of the trunk open a
little.</p>
<p>When it was fixed upright, he himself first jumped over it, and then
he said to the veele, &ldquo;Now it is your turn. Let us see if you can
spring over the tree!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href=
"#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span></p>
<p>One veele attempted to spring over, but the same moment the prince
knocked the wedge out, and the trunk closing at once held the veele
fast. Then all the other fairies were alarmed, and begged him to open
the trunk and let their sister free, promising, in return, to give him
<span class="corr" id="xd19e6304" title="Source: any-">anything</span>
he might ask. The prince said, &ldquo;I want nothing except to keep my
own eyes, and to restore eyesight to that poor old man.&rdquo; So the
fairies gave him a certain herb, and told him to lay it over the old
man&rsquo;s eyes, and then he would recover his sight. The prince took
the herb, opened the tree a little so as to let the fairy free, and
then rode back on the goat to the cave, driving the other goats before
him. When he arrived there he placed at once the herb on the old
man&rsquo;s eyes, and in a moment his eyesight came back, to his
exceeding surprise and joy.</p>
<p>Next morning the old man, before he drove out his goats, gave the
prince the keys of eight closets in the cave, but warned him on no
account to open the ninth closet, although the key hung directly over
the door. Then he went out, telling the prince to take good care that
the corn was ready for their suppers.</p>
<p>Left alone in the cave, the young man began to wonder what might be
in the ninth closet, and at last he could not resist the temptation to
take down the key and open the door to look in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6311">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6312" class="main">The Golden Horse</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What was his surprise to see there a golden horse,
with a golden greyhound beside him, and near them a golden hen and
golden chickens were busy picking up golden millet-seeds.</p>
<p>The young prince gazed at them for some time, admiring their beauty,
and then he spoke to the golden horse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>&ldquo;Friend, I
think we had better leave this place before the old man comes back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the golden horse, &ldquo;I am
quite willing to go away, only you must take heed to what I am going to
tell. Go and find linen cloth enough to spread over the stones at the
mouth of the cave, for if the old man hears the ring of my hoofs he
will be certain to kill you. Then you must take with you a little
stone, a drop of water, and a pair of scissors, and the moment I tell
you to throw them down you must obey me quickly, or you are
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince did everything that the golden horse had ordered him, and
then, taking up the golden hen with her chickens in a bag, he placed it
under his arm, and mounted the horse and rode quickly out of the cave,
leading with him, in a leash, the golden greyhound. But the moment they
were in the open air the old man, although he was very far off, tending
his goats on a distant mountain, heard the clang of the golden hoofs,
and cried to his great goat, &ldquo;They have run away. Let us follow
them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a wonderfully short time the old man on his great goat came so
near the prince on his golden horse, that the latter shouted,
&ldquo;Throw now the little stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment the prince had thrown it down, a high rocky mountain rose
up between him and the old man, and before the goat had climbed over
it, the golden horse had gained much ground. Very soon, however, the
old man was so nearly catching them that the horse shouted,
&ldquo;Throw, now, the drop of water!&rdquo; The prince obeyed
instantly, and immediately saw a broad river flowing between him and
his pursuer.</p>
<p>It took the old man on his goat so long to cross the river
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>that the prince on his golden horse was far away
before them; but for all that it was not very long before the horse
heard the goat so near behind him that he shouted, &ldquo;Throw the
scissors.&rdquo; The prince threw them, and the goat, running over
them, injured one of his fore legs very badly. When the old man saw
this, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Now I see I cannot catch you, so you may
keep what you have taken. But you will do wisely to listen to my
counsel. People will be sure to kill you for the sake of your golden
horse, so you had better buy at once a donkey, and take the hide to
cover your horse. And do the same with your golden
greyhound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the old man turned and rode back to his cave; and
the prince lost no time in attending to his advice, and covered with
donkey-hide his golden horse and his golden hound.</p>
<p>After travelling a long time the prince came unawares to the kingdom
of his father. There he heard that the king had had a ditch dug, three
hundred yards wide and four hundred yards deep, and had proclaimed that
whosoever should leap his horse over it, should have the princess, his
daughter, for wife.</p>
<p>Almost a whole year had elapsed since the proclamation was issued,
but as yet no one had dared to risk the leap. When the prince heard
this, he said, &ldquo;<i>I</i> will leap over it with my donkey and my
dog!&rdquo; and he leapt over it.</p>
<p>But the king was very angry when he heard that a poorly dressed man,
on a donkey, had dared to leap over the great ditch which had
frightened back his bravest knights; so he had the disguised prince
thrown into one of his deepest dungeons, together with his donkey and
his dog.</p>
<p>Next morning the king sent some of his servants to see if the man
was still living, and these soon ran back to him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>full
of wonder, and told him that they had found in the dungeon, instead of
a poor man and his donkey, a young man, beautifully dressed, a golden
horse, a golden greyhound, and a golden hen, surrounded by golden
chickens, which were picking up golden millet-seeds from the ground.
Then the king said, &ldquo;That must be some powerful prince.&rdquo; So
he ordered the queen, and the princes, his sons, to prepare all things
for the stranger to wash his hands. Then he went down himself into the
dungeon, and led the prince up with much courtesy, desiring to make
thus amends for the past ill-treatment.</p>
<p>The king himself took a golden ewer full of water, and poured some
over the prince&rsquo;s hands, whilst the two princes held the basin
under them, and the queen held out fine towels to dry them on.</p>
<p>This done, the young prince exclaimed, &ldquo;Now, my dream is
fulfilled&rdquo;; and they all at once recognized him, and were very
glad to see him once again amongst them.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was an old man who, whenever he
heard anyone complain how many sons he had to care for, always laughed
and said, &ldquo;I wish that it would please God to give me a hundred
sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he said in jest; as time went on, however, he had, in reality,
neither more nor less than a hundred sons.</p>
<p>He had trouble enough to find different trades for his sons, but
when they were once all started in life they worked diligently and
gained plenty of money. Now, however, came a fresh difficulty. One day
the eldest son came in to his father and said, &ldquo;My dear father, I
think it is quite time that I should marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he said these words before the second son <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>came
in, saying, &ldquo;Dear father, I think it is already time that you
were looking out for a wife for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later came in the third son, asking, &ldquo;Dear father,
don&rsquo;t you think it is high time that you should find me a
wife?&rdquo; In like manner came the fourth and fifth, until the whole
hundred had made a similar request. All of them wished to marry, and
desired their father to find wives for them as soon as he could.</p>
<p>The old man was not a little troubled at these requests; he said,
however, to his sons, &ldquo;Very well, my sons, <i>I</i> have nothing
to say against your marrying; there is, however, I foresee, one great
difficulty in the way. There are one hundred of you asking for wives,
and I hardly think we can find one hundred marriageable girls in all
the fifteen villages which are in our neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the sons, however, answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious
about that, but mount your horse and take in your sack sufficient
engagement-cakes. You must take, also, a stick in your hand so that you
can cut a notch in it for every girl you see. It does not signify
whether she be handsome or ugly, or lame or blind, just cut a notch in
your stick for every one you meet with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said, &ldquo;Very wisely spoken, my sons! I will do
exactly as you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he mounted his horse, took a sack full of cakes on his
shoulder and a long stick in his hand, and started off at once to beat
up the neighbourhood for girls to marry his sons.</p>
<p>The old man had travelled from village to village during a whole
month, and whenever he had seen a girl he cut a notch in his stick. But
he was getting pretty well tired, and he began to count how many
notches he had already made. When he had counted them carefully over
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>over again, to be certain that he had counted
all, he could only make out seventy-four, so that still twenty-six were
wanting to complete the number required. He was, however, so weary with
his month&rsquo;s ride that he determined to return home. As he rode
along, he saw a priest driving oxen yoked to a plough, and seemingly
very deep in anxious thought about something. Now the old man wondered
a little to see the priest ploughing his own corn-fields without even a
boy to help him; he therefore shouted to ask him why he drove his oxen
himself. The priest, however, did not even turn his head to see who
called to him, so intent was he in urging on his oxen and in guiding
his plough.</p>
<p>The old man thought he had not spoken loud enough, so he shouted out
again as loud as he could, &ldquo;Stop your oxen a little, and tell me
why you are ploughing yourself without even a lad to help you, and
this, too, on a holy-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the priest&mdash;who was in a perspiration with his hard
work&mdash;answered testily, &ldquo;I conjure you by your old age leave
me in peace! I cannot tell you my ill-luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6387">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6388" class="main">The Hundred Daughters</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this answer, however, the old man was only the more
curious, and persisted all the more earnestly in asking questions to
find out why the priest ploughed on a saint&rsquo;s day. At last the
priest, tired with his importunity, sighed deeply and said,
&ldquo;Well, if you <i>will</i> know: I am the only man in my
household, and God has blessed me with a hundred daughters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was overjoyed at hearing this, and exclaimed cheerfully,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good! It is just what I want, for <i>I</i>
have a hundred sons, and so, as you have a hundred daughters, we can be
friends!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331"
name="pb331">331</a>]</span></p>
<p>The moment the priest heard this he became pleasant and talkative,
and invited the old man to pass the night in his house. Then, leaving
his plough in the field, he drove the oxen back to the village. Just
before reaching his house, however, he said to the old man, &ldquo;Go
yourself into the house whilst I tie up my oxen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner, however, had the old man entered the yard than the wife
of the priest rushed at him with a big stick, crying out, &ldquo;We
have not bread enough for our hundred daughters, and we want neither
beggars nor visitors,&rdquo; and with these words she drove him
away.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the priest came out of the barn, and, finding the
old man sitting on the road before the gate, asked him why he had not
gone into the house as he had told him to do. Whereupon the old man
replied, &ldquo;I went in, but your wife drove me away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the priest said, &ldquo;Only wait here a moment till I come
back to fetch you.&rdquo; He then went quickly into his house and
scolded his wife right well, saying, &ldquo;What have you done? What a
fine chance you have spoiled! The man who came in was going to be our
friend, for he has a hundred sons who would gladly have married our
hundred daughters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the wife heard this she changed her dress hastily, and arranged
her hair and head-dress in a different fashion. Then she smiled very
sweetly, and welcomed with the greatest possible politeness the old
man, when her husband led him into the house. In fact, she pretended
that she knew nothing at all of anyone having been driven away from
their door. And as the old man wanted much to find wives for his sons,
he also pretended that he did not know that the smiling house-mistress
and the woman who drove him away with a stick were one and the selfsame
person. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the old man passed the night in the house, and next morning asked
the priest formally to give him his hundred daughters for wives for his
hundred sons. Thereupon the priest answered that he was quite willing,
and had already spoken to his daughters about the matter, and that
they, too, were all quite willing. Then the old man took out his
&ldquo;engagement-cakes,&rdquo; and put them on the table beside him,
and gave each of the girls a piece of money to <i>mark</i>. Then each
of the engaged girls sent a small present by him to that one of his
sons to whom she was thus betrothed. These gifts the old man put in the
bag wherein he had carried the &ldquo;engagement-cakes.&rdquo; He then
mounted his horse, and rode off merrily homewards. There were great
rejoicings in his household when he told how successful he had been in
his search, and that he really had found a hundred girls ready and
willing to be married; and these hundred, too, a priest&rsquo;s
daughters.</p>
<p>The sons insisted that they should begin to make the wedding
preparations without delay, and commenced at once to invite the guests
who were to form part of the wedding procession to go to the
priest&rsquo;s house and bring home the brides.</p>
<p>Here, however, another difficulty occurred. The old father must find
two hundred bride-leaders (two for each bride); one hundred kooms; one
hundred starisvats; one hundred chaious (running footmen who go before
the processions); and three hundred vojvodes (standard-bearers); and,
besides these, a respectable number of other non-official guests. To
find all these persons the father had to hunt throughout the
neighbourhood for three years; at last, however, they were all found,
and a day was appointed when they were to meet at his house, and go
thence in procession to the house of the priest. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6423">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6424" class="main">The Wedding Procession</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the appointed day all the invited guests gathered
at the old man&rsquo;s house. With great noise and confusion, after a
fair amount of feasting, the wedding procession was formed properly,
and set out for the house of the priest, where the hundred brides were
already prepared for their departure for their new home.</p>
<p>So great was the confusion, indeed, that the old man quite forgot to
take with him one of the hundred sons, and never missed him in the
greeting and talking and drinking he was obliged, as father of the
bridegrooms, to go through. Now the young man had worked so long and so
hard in preparing for the wedding-day that he never woke up till long
after the procession had started; and every one had had, like his
father, too much to do and too many things to think of to miss him.</p>
<p>The wedding procession arrived in good order at the priest&rsquo;s
house, where a feast was already spread out for them. Having done
honour to the various good things, and having gone through all the
ceremonies usual on such occasions, the hundred brides were given over
to their &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; and the procession started on its
return to the old man&rsquo;s house. But, as they did not set off until
pretty late in the afternoon, it was decided that the night should be
spent somewhere on the road. When they came, therefore, to a certain
river named &ldquo;Luckless,&rdquo; as it was already dark, some of the
men proposed that the party should pass the night by the side of the
water without crossing over. However, some others of the chief of the
party so warmly advised the crossing the river and encamping on the
other bank, that this course was at length, after a very lively
discussion, determined on; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href=
"#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>accordingly the procession began
to move over the bridge.</p>
<p>Just, however, as the wedding party were half-way across the bridge
its two sides began to draw nearer each other, and pressed the people
so close together that they had hardly room to breathe&mdash;much less
could they move forwards or backwards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6436">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6437" class="main">The Black Giant</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They were kept for some time in this position, some
shouting and scolding, others quiet because frightened, until at length
a black giant appeared, and shouted to them in a terribly loud voice,
&ldquo;Who are you all? Where do you come from? Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the bolder among them answered, &ldquo;We are going to our
old friend&rsquo;s house, taking home the hundred brides for his
hundred sons; but unluckily we ventured on this bridge after nightfall,
and it has pressed us so tightly together that we cannot move one way
or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is your old friend?&rdquo; inquired the black
giant.</p>
<p>Now all the wedding guests turned their eyes towards the old man.
Thereupon he turned towards the giant, who instantly said to him,
&ldquo;Listen, old man! Will you give me what you have forgotten at
home, if I let your friends pass over the bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man considered some time what it might be that he had
forgotten at home, but, at last, not being able to recollect anything
in particular that he had left, and hearing on all sides the groans and
moans of his guests, he replied, &ldquo;Well, I will give it you, if
you will only let the procession pass over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the black giant said to the party, &ldquo;You all hear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>what he has promised, and are all my witnesses
to the bargain. In three days I shall come to fetch what I have
bargained for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the black giant widened the bridge and the whole
procession passed on to the other bank in safety. The people, however,
no longer wished to spend the night on the way, so they moved on as
fast as they could, and early in the morning reached the old
man&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>As everybody talked of the strange adventure they had met with, the
eldest son, who had been left at home, soon began to understand how the
matter stood, and went to his father saying, &ldquo;O my father! you
have sold <i>me</i> to the black giant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old man was very sorry, and troubled; but his friends
comforted him, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened! nothing will
come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marriage ceremonies were celebrated with great rejoicings. Just,
however, as the festivities were at their height, on the third day, the
black giant appeared at the gate and shouted, &ldquo;Now, give me at
once what you have promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, trembling all over, went forward and asked him,
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but what you have promised me!&rdquo; returned the
black giant.</p>
<p>As he could not break his promise, the old man, very distressed, was
then obliged to deliver up his eldest son to the giant, who thereupon
said, &ldquo;Now I shall take your son with me, but after three years
have passed you can come to the Luckless River and take him
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this the black giant disappeared, taking with him the
young man, whom he carried off to his workshop as an apprentice to the
trade of witchcraft. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336"
name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>From that time the poor old man had not a single moment of
happiness. He was always sad and anxious, and counted every year, and
month, and week, and even every day, until the dawn of the last day of
the three years. Then he took a staff in his hand and hurried off to
the bank of the river Luckless. As soon as he reached the river, he was
met by the black giant, who asked him, &ldquo;Why are you come?&rdquo;
The old man answered that he come to take home his son, according to
his agreement.</p>
<p>Thereupon the giant brought out a tray on which stood a sparrow, a
turtle-dove, and a quail, and said to the old man, &ldquo;Now, if you
can tell which of these is your son, you may take him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor old father looked intently at the three birds, one after
the other, and over and over again, but at last he was forced to own
that he could not tell which of them was his son. So he was obliged to
go away by himself, and was far more miserable than before. He had
hardly, however, got half-way home when he thought he would go back to
the river and take one of the birds which remembered and looked at him
intently.</p>
<p>When he reached the river Luckless he was again met by the black
giant, who brought out the tray again, and placed on it this time a
partridge, a tit-mouse, and a thrush, saying, &lsquo;Now, my old man,
find out which is your son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The anxious father again looked at one bird after the other, but he
felt more uncertain than before, and so, crying bitterly, again went
away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6484">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6485" class="main">The Old Woman</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Just as the old man was going through a forest, which
was between the river Luckless and his house, an old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>woman met him, and said, &ldquo;Stop a moment!
Where are you hurrying to? And why are you in such trouble?&rdquo; Now,
the old man was so deeply musing over his great unhappiness that he did
not at first attend to the old woman; but she followed him, calling
after him, and repeating her questions with more earnestness. So he
stopped at last, and told her what a terrible misfortune had fallen
upon him. When the old woman had listened to the whole story, she said
cheerfully, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cast down! Don&rsquo;t be afraid! Go
back again to the river, and, when the giant brings out the three
birds, look into their eyes sharply. When you see that one of the birds
has a tear in one of its eyes, seize that bird and hold it fast, for it
has a human soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man thanked her heartily for her advice, and turned back,
for the third time, towards the Luckless River. Again the black giant
appeared, and looked very merry whilst he brought out his tray and put
upon it a sparrow, a dove, and a woodpecker, saying, &ldquo;My old man!
find out which is your son!&rdquo; Then the father looked sharply into
the eyes of the birds, and saw that from the right eye of the dove a
tear dropped slowly down. In a moment he grasped the bird tightly,
saying, &ldquo;This is my son!&rdquo; The next moment he found himself
holding fast his eldest son by the shoulder, and so, singing and
shouting in his great joy, took him quickly home, and gave him over to
his eldest daughter-in-law, the wife of his son.</p>
<p>Now, for some time they all lived together very happily. One day,
however, the young man said to his father, &ldquo;Whilst I was
apprentice in the workshop of the black giant, I learned a great many
tricks of witchcraft. Now I intend to change myself into a fine horse,
and you shall take me to market and sell me for a good sum of money.
But be sure not to give up the halter.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span></p>
<p>The father did as the son had said. Next market day he went to the
city with a fine horse which he offered for sale. Many buyers came
round him, admiring the horse, and bidding some sums for it, so that at
last the old man was able to sell it for two thousand ducats. When he
received the money, he took good care not to let go the halter, and he
returned home far richer than he ever dreamt of being.</p>
<p>A few days later, the man who had bought the horse sent his servant
with it to the river to bathe, and, whilst in the water, the horse got
loose from the servant and galloped off into the neighbouring forest.
There he changed himself back into his real shape, and returned to his
father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>After some time had passed, the young man said one day to his
father, &ldquo;Now I will change myself into an ox, and you can take me
to market to sell me; but take care not to give up the rope with which
you lead me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So next market-day the old man went to the city leading a very fine
ox, and soon found a buyer, who offered ten times the usual price paid
for an ox. The buyer asked also for the rope to lead the animal home,
but the old man said, &ldquo;What do you want with such an old thing?
You had better buy a new one!&rdquo; and he went off taking with him
the rope.</p>
<p>That evening, whilst the servants of the buyer were driving the ox
to the field, he ran away into a wood near, and, having taken there his
human shape, returned home to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>On the eve of the next market-day, the young man said to his father:
&ldquo;Now I will change myself into a cow with golden horns, and you
can sell me as before, only take care not to give up the string.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p>Accordingly he changed himself next morning into a cow, and the old
man took it to the market-place, and asked for it three hundred
crowns.</p>
<p>But the black giant had learnt that his former apprentice was making
a great deal of money by practising the trade he had taught him, and,
being jealous at this, he determined to put an end to the young
man&rsquo;s gains.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6514">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6515" class="main">The Giant buys the Cow</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Therefore, on the third day he came to the market
himself as a buyer, and the moment he saw the beautiful cow with golden
horns he knew that it could be no other than his former apprentice. So
he came up to the old man, and, having outbid all the other would-be
purchasers, paid at once the price he had agreed on. Having done this,
he caught the string in his hand, and tried to wrench it from the
terrified old man, who called out, &ldquo;I have not sold you the
string, but the cow!&rdquo; and held the string as fast as he could
with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said the buyer, &ldquo;I have the law and
custom on my side! Whoever buys a cow, buys also the string with which
it is led!&rdquo; Some of the amused and astonished lookers-on said
that this was quite true, therefore the old man was obliged to give up
the string.</p>
<p>The black giant, well satisfied with his purchase, took the cow with
him to his castle, and, after having put iron chains on her legs,
fastened her in a cellar. Every morning the giant gave the cow some
water and hay, but he never unchained her.</p>
<p>One evening, however, the cow, with incessant struggles, managed to
get free from the chains, and immediately opened the cellar-door with
her horns and ran away.</p>
<p>Next morning the black giant went as usual into the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>cellar, carrying the hay and water for the cow;
but seeing she had got free and run away, he threw the hay down, and
started off at once to pursue her.</p>
<p>When he came within sight of her, he turned himself into a wolf and
ran at her with great fury; but his clever apprentice changed himself
instantly from a cow into a bear, whereupon the giant turned himself
from a wolf into a lion; the bear then turned into a tiger, and the
lion changed into a crocodile, whereupon the tiger turned into a
sparrow. Upon this the giant changed from the form of a crocodile into
a hawk, and the apprentice immediately changed into a hare; on seeing
which the hawk became a greyhound. Then the apprentice changed from a
hare into a falcon, and the greyhound into an eagle; whereupon the
apprentice changed into a fish. The giant then turned from an eagle
into a mouse, and immediately the apprentice, as a cat, ran after him;
then the giant turned himself into a heap of millet, and the apprentice
transformed himself into a hen and chickens, which very greedily picked
up all the millet except one single seed, in which the master was, who
changed himself into a squirrel; instantly, however, the apprentice
became a hawk, and, pouncing on the squirrel, killed it.</p>
<p>In this way the apprentice beat his master, the black giant, and
revenged himself for all the sufferings he had endured whilst learning
the trade of witchcraft. Having killed the squirrel, the hawk took his
proper shape again, and the young man returned joyfully to his father,
whom he made immensely rich.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6534" class="main">XIX. The Trade that No One Knows</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long while ago there lived a poor old couple, who
had an only son. The old man and his wife worked very hard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>to
nourish their child well and bring him up properly, hoping that he, in
return, would take care of them in their old age.</p>
<p>When, however, the boy had grown up, he said to his parents,
&ldquo;I am a man now, and I intend to marry, so I wish you to go at
once to the king and ask him to give me his daughter for wife.&rdquo;
The astonished parents rebuked him, saying: &ldquo;What can you be
thinking of? We have only this poor hut to shelter us, and hardly bread
enough to eat, and we dare not presume to go into the king&rsquo;s
presence, much less can we venture to ask for his daughter to be your
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son, however, insisted that they should do as he said,
threatening that if they did not comply with his wishes he would leave
them, and go away into the world. Seeing that he was really in earnest
in what he said, the unhappy parents promised him they would go and ask
for the king&rsquo;s daughter. Then the old mother made a wedding cake
in her son&rsquo;s presence, and, when it was ready, she put it in a
bag, took her staff in her hand, and went straight to the palace where
the king lived. There the king&rsquo;s servants bade her come in, and
led her into the hall where his Majesty was accustomed to receive the
poor people who came to ask alms or to present petitions.</p>
<p>The poor old woman stood in the hall, confused and ashamed at her
worn-out, shabby clothes, and looking as if she were made of stone,
until the king said to her kindly: &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> want from
me, old mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dared not, however, tell his Majesty why she had come, so she
stammered out in her confusion: &ldquo;Nothing, your
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king smiled a little and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you come to
ask alms?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342"
name="pb342">342</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the old woman, much abashed, replied: &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty,
if you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the king called his servants and ordered them to give the
old woman ten crowns, which they did. Having received this money, she
thanked his Majesty, and returned home, saying to herself: &ldquo;I
dare say when my son sees all this money he will not think any more of
going away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this thought, however, she was quite mistaken, for no sooner had
she entered the hut than the son came to her and asked impatiently:
&ldquo;Well, mother, have you done as I asked you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this she exclaimed: &ldquo;Do give up, once for all, this silly
fancy, my son. How could you expect me to ask the king for his daughter
to be your wife? That would be a bold thing for a rich nobleman to do,
how then can <i>we</i> think of such a thing? Anyhow, <i>I</i> dared
not say one word to the king about it. But only look what a lot of
money I have brought back. Now you can look for a wife suitable for
you, and then you will forget the king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young man heard his mother speak thus, he grew very angry,
and said to her: &ldquo;What do I want with the king&rsquo;s money? I
don&rsquo;t want his money, but I <i>do</i> want his daughter! I see
you are only playing with me, so I shall leave you. I will go away
somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;wherever my eyes lead me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the poor old parents prayed and begged him not to go away from
them, and leave them alone in their old age; but they could only quiet
him by promising faithfully that the mother should go again next day to
the king, and this time really ask him to give his daughter to her son
for a wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the morning, therefore, the old woman went again to the palace,
and the servants showed her into the same hall she had been in before.
The king, seeing her stand there, inquired: &ldquo;What want you, my
old woman, now?&rdquo; She was, however, so ashamed that she could
hardly stammer, &ldquo;Nothing, please your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, supposing that she came again to beg, ordered his servants
to give this time also ten crowns.</p>
<p>With this money the poor woman returned to her hut, where her son
met her, asking: &ldquo;Well, mother, <i>this</i> time I hope you have
done what I asked you?&rdquo; But she replied: &ldquo;Now, my dear son,
do leave the king&rsquo;s daughter in peace. How can you really think
of such a thing? Even if she would marry you, where is the house to
bring her to? So be quiet, and take this money which I have brought
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the son was more angry than before, and said sharply:
&ldquo;As I see you will not let me marry the king&rsquo;s daughter, I
will leave you this moment and never come back again;&rdquo; and,
rushing out of the hut, he ran away. His parents hurried after him, and
at length prevailed on him to return, by swearing to him that his
mother should go again to the king next morning, and really and in
truth ask his Majesty this time for his daughter.</p>
<p>So the young man agreed to go back home and wait until the next
day.</p>
<p>On the morrow the old woman, with a heavy heart, went to the palace,
and was shown as before into the king&rsquo;s presence. Seeing her
there for the third time, his Majesty asked her impatiently:
&ldquo;What do you want this time, old woman?&rdquo; And she, trembling
all over, said: &ldquo;Please your Majesty&mdash;nothing.&rdquo; Then
the king exclaimed: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344"
name="pb344">344</a>]</span>&ldquo;But it cannot be nothing. Something
you must want, so tell me truth at once, if you value your life!&rdquo;
Thereupon the old woman was forced to tell all the story to the king;
how her son had a great desire to marry the princess, and so had forced
her to come and ask the king to give her him to wife.</p>
<p>When the king had heard everything, he said: &ldquo;Well, after all,
<i>I</i> shall say nothing against it if my daughter will consent to
it.&rdquo; He then told his servants to lead the princess into his
presence. When she came he told her all about the affair, and asked
her, &ldquo;Are you willing to marry the son of this old
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6599">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6600" class="main">The Condition</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The princess answered: &ldquo;Why not? If only he
learns first the trade that no one knows!&rdquo; Thereupon the king
bade his attendants give money to the poor woman, who now went back to
her hut with a light heart.</p>
<p>The moment she entered her son asked her: &ldquo;Have you engaged
her?&rdquo; And she returned: &ldquo;Do let me get my breath a little!
Well, <i>now</i> I have really asked the king: but it is of no use, for
the princess declares she will not marry you until you have learnt the
trade that no one knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that matters nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed the son.
&ldquo;Now I only know the condition, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; The
next morning the young man set out on his travels through the world in
search of a man who could teach him the trade that no one knows. He
wandered about a long time without being able to find out where he
could learn such a trade. At length one day, being quite tired out with
walking and very sad, he sat down on a fallen log by the wayside. After
he had sat thus a little while, an old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>woman came up to him,
and asked: &ldquo;Why art thou so sad, my son?&rdquo; And he answered:
&ldquo;What is the use of your asking, when you cannot help me?&rdquo;
But she continued: &ldquo;Only tell me what is the matter, and perhaps
I can help you.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;Well, if you must know, the
matter is this: I have been travelling about the world a long time to
find a master who can teach me the trade that no one knows.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, if it is only that,&rdquo; cried the old woman, &ldquo;just
listen to me! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, but go straight into the forest
which lies before you, and there you will find what you
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was very glad to hear this, and got up at once and
went to the forest. When he had gone pretty far in the wood he saw a
large castle, and whilst he stood looking at it and wondering what it
was, four giants came out of it and ran up to him, shouting: &ldquo;Do
you wish to learn the trade that no one knows?&rdquo; He said:
&ldquo;Yes; that is just the reason why I come here.&rdquo; Whereupon
they took him into the castle.</p>
<p>Next morning the giants prepared to go out hunting, and, before
leaving, they said to him: &ldquo;You must on no account go into the
first room by the dining-hall.&rdquo; Hardly, however, were the giants
well out of sight before the young man began to reason thus with
himself: &ldquo;I see very well that I have come into a place from
which I shall never go out alive with my head, so I may as well see
what is in the room, come what may afterwards.&rdquo; So he went and
opened the door a little and peeped in. There stood a golden ass, bound
to a golden manger. He looked at it a little, and was just going to
shut the door when the ass said: &ldquo;Come and take the halter from
my head, and keep it hidden about you. It will serve you well if you
only understand how to use it.&rdquo; So he took the halter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>and, after fastening the room-door, quickly
concealed it under his clothes. He had not sat very long before the
giants came home. They asked him at once if he had been in the first
room, and he, much frightened, replied: &ldquo;No, I have not been
in.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we know that you have been!&rdquo; said the
giants in great anger, and seizing some large sticks they beat him so
severely that he could hardly stand on his feet. It was very lucky for
him that he had the halter wound round his body under his clothes, or
else he would certainly have been killed.</p>
<p>The next day the giants again prepared to go out hunting, but before
leaving him they ordered him on no account to enter the second
room.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the giants had gone away he became so very curious
to see what might be in the second room, that he could not resist going
to the door. He stood there a little, thinking within himself,
&ldquo;Well, I am already more dead than alive, much worse cannot
happen to me!&rdquo; and so he opened the door and looked in. There he
was surprised to see a very beautiful girl, dressed all in gold and
silver, who sat combing her hair, and setting in every tress a large
diamond. He stood admiring her a little while, and was just going to
shut the door again, when she spoke, &ldquo;Wait a minute, young man.
Come and take this key, and mind you keep it safely. It will serve you
some time, if you only know how to use it.&rdquo; So he went in and
took the key from the girl, and then, going out, fastened the door and
went and sat down in the same place he had sat before.</p>
<p>He had not remained there very long before the giants came home from
hunting. The moment they entered the house they took up their large
sticks to beat him, asking, at the same time, whether he had been in
the second room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>Shaking all over with fear, he answered
them, &ldquo;No, I have not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we know you have been,&rdquo; shouted the giants in great
anger, and they then beat him worse than on the first day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6629">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6630" class="main">The Third Room</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning, as the giants went out as usual to
hunt, they said to him: &ldquo;Do not go into the third room, for
anything in the world; for if you do go in we shall not forgive you as
we did yesterday, and the day before! We shall kill you
outright!&rdquo; No sooner, however, had the giants gone out of sight,
than the young man began to say to himself, &ldquo;Most likely they
will kill me, whether I go into the room or not. Besides, if they do
not kill me, they have beaten me so badly already that I am sure I
cannot live long, so, anyhow, I will go and see what is in <span class=
"corr" id="xd19e6634" title="Not in source">the</span> third
room.&rdquo; Then he got up and went and opened the door.</p>
<p>He was quite shocked, however, when he saw that the room was full of
human heads! These heads belonged to young men who had come, like
himself, to learn the trade that no one knows, and who, having obeyed
faithfully and strictly the orders of the giants, had been killed by
them.</p>
<p>The young man was turning quickly to go away when one of the heads
called out: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, but come in!&rdquo; Thereupon
he went into the room. Then the head gave him an iron chain, and said:
&ldquo;Take care of this chain, for it will serve you some time if you
know how to use it!&rdquo; So he took the chain, and going out fastened
the door.</p>
<p>He went and sat down in the usual place to wait for the coming home
of the giants, and, as he waited, he grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>quite frightened, for
he fully expected that they would really kill him this time.</p>
<p>The instant the giants came home they took up their thick sticks and
began to beat him without stopping to ask anything. They beat him so
terribly that he was all but dead; then they threw him out of the
house, saying to him: &ldquo;Go away now, since you have learnt the
trade that no one knows!&rdquo; When he had lain a long time on the
ground where they had thrown him, feeling very sore and miserable, at
length he tried to move away, saying to himself: &ldquo;Well, if they
really have taught me the trade that no one knows for the sake of the
king&rsquo;s daughter I can suffer gladly all this pain, if I can only
win her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After travelling for a long time, the young man came at last to the
palace of the king whose daughter he wished to marry. When he saw the
palace, he was exceedingly sad, and remembered the words of the
princess; for, after all his wanderings and sufferings, he had learnt
no trade, and had never been able to find what trade it was &ldquo;that
no one knows.&rdquo; Whilst considering what he had better do, he
suddenly recollected the halter, the key and the iron chain, which he
had carried concealed about him ever since he left the castle of the
four giants. He then said to himself, &ldquo;Let me see what these
things can do!&rdquo; So he took the halter and struck the earth with
it, and immediately a handsome horse, beautifully caparisoned, stood
before him. Then he struck the ground with the iron chain, and
instantly a hare and a greyhound appeared, and the hare began to run
quickly and the greyhound to follow her. In a moment the young man
hardly knew himself, for he found himself in a fine hunting-dress,
riding on the horse after the hare, which took a path that passed
immediately under the windows of the king&rsquo;s palace. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, it happened that the king stood at a window looking out, and
noticed at once the beautiful greyhound which was chasing the hare, and
the very handsome horse which a huntsman in a splendid dress was
mounted on. The king was so pleased with the appearance of the horse
and the greyhound that he called instantly some of his servants, and,
sending them after the strange rider, bade them invite him to come to
the palace. The young man, however, hearing some people coming behind
him calling and shouting, rode quickly behind a thick bush, and shook a
little the halter and the iron chain. In a moment the horse, the
greyhound, and the hare had vanished, and he found himself sitting on
the ground under the trees dressed in his old shabby clothes. By this
time the king&rsquo;s servants had come up, and, seeing him sit there,
they asked him whether he had seen a fine huntsman on a beautiful horse
pass that way. But he answered them rudely: &ldquo;No! I have not seen
any one pass, neither do I care to look to see who passes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king&rsquo;s servants went on and searched the forest,
calling and shouting as loudly as they could, but it was all in vain;
they could neither see nor hear anything of the hunter. At length they
went back to the king, and told him that the horse the huntsman rode
was so exceedingly quick that they could not hear anything of him in
the forest.</p>

<h4 id="xd19e6656" class="main">The Son Returns</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The young man now resolved to go to the hut where his
old parents lived; and they were glad to see that he had come back to
them once more.</p>
<p>Next morning, the son said to his father: &ldquo;Now, father, I will
show you what I have learned. I will change myself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>into
a beautiful horse, and you must lead me into the city and sell me, but
be very careful not to give away the halter, or else I shall remain
always a horse!&rdquo; Accordingly, in a moment he changed himself into
a horse of extraordinary beauty, and the father took him to the
market-place to sell him. Very soon a great number of people gathered
round the horse, wondering at his unusual beauty, and very high prices
were offered for him; the old man, however, raised the price higher and
higher at every offer. The news spread quickly about the city that a
wonderfully handsome horse was for sale in the market-place, and at
length the king himself heard of it, and sent some servants to bring
the horse, that he might see it. The old man led the horse at once
before the palace, and the king, after looking at it for some time with
great admiration, could not help exclaiming, &ldquo;By my word, though
I am a king, I never yet saw, much less rode, so handsome a
horse!&rdquo; Then he asked the old man if he would sell it him.
&ldquo;I will sell it to your Majesty, very willingly,&rdquo; said the
old man; &ldquo;but I will sell only the horse, and not the
halter.&rdquo; Thereupon the king laughed, saying: &ldquo;What should I
want with your dirty halter? For such a horse I will have a halter of
gold made!&rdquo; So the horse was sold to the king for a very high
price, and the old man returned home with the money.</p>
<p>Next morning, however, there was a great stir and much consternation
in the royal stables, for the beautiful horse had vanished somehow
during the night. And at the time when the horse disappeared, the young
man returned to his parents&rsquo; hut.</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards the young man said to his father: &ldquo;Now
I will turn myself into a fine church not far from the king&rsquo;s
palace, and if the king wishes to buy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>it you may sell it
him, only be sure not to part with the key or else I must remain always
a church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king got up that morning, and went to his window to look
out, he saw a beautiful church which he had never noticed before. Then
he sent his servants out to see what it was, and soon after they came
back saying, that &ldquo;the church belonged to an old pilgrim, who
told them that he was willing to sell it if the king wished to buy
it.&rdquo; Then the king sent to ask what price he would sell it for,
and the pilgrim replied: &ldquo;It is worth a great deal of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6672">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6673" class="main">The King Outbid</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Whilst the servants were bargaining with the father an
old woman came up. Now this was the same old woman who had sent the
young man to the castle of the four giants, and she herself had been
there and had learnt the trade that no one knew. As she understood at
once all about the church, and had no mind to have a rival in the
trade, she resolved to put an end to the young man. For this purpose
she began to outbid the king, and offered, at last, so very large a sum
of ready money, that the old man was quite astonished and confused at
seeing the money which she showed him. He accordingly accepted her
offer, but whilst he was counting the money, quite forgot about the
key. Before long, however, he recollected what his son had said, and
then, fearing some mischief, he ran after old woman and demanded the
key back. But the woman could not be persuaded to give back the key,
and said it belonged to the church which she had bought and paid for.
Seeing she would not give up the key, the old man grew more and more
alarmed, lest some ill should befall his son, so he took hold of the
old woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>by the neck and forced her to drop the key. She
struggled very hard to get it back again, and, whilst the old man and
she wrestled together, the key changed itself suddenly into a dove and
flew away high in the air over the palace gardens.</p>
<p>When the old woman saw this, she changed herself into a hawk, and
chased the dove. Just, however, as the hawk was about to pounce upon
it, the dove turned itself into a beautiful bouquet, and dropped down
into the hand of the king&rsquo;s daughter, who happened to be walking
in the garden. Then the hawk changed again into the old woman, who went
to the gate of the palace and begged very hard that the princess would
give that bouquet, or, at least, one single flower from it.</p>
<p>But the princess said, &ldquo;No! not for anything in the world!
These flowers fell to me from heaven!&rdquo; The old woman, however,
was determined to get one flower from the bouquet, so, seeing the
princess would not hear her, she went straight to the king, and begged
piteously that he would order his daughter to give her one of the
flowers from her bouquet. The king, thinking the old woman wanted one
of the flowers to cure some disease, called his daughter to him, and
told her to give one to the beggar.</p>
<p>But just as the king said this, the bouquet changed itself into a
heap of millet-seed and scattered itself all over the ground. Then the
old woman quickly changed herself into a hen and chickens, and began
greedily to pick up the seeds. Suddenly, however, the millet vanished,
and in its place appeared a fox, which sprang on the hen and killed
her.</p>
<p>Then the fox changed into the young man, who explained to the
astonished king and princess that he it was who had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>demanded the hand of the princess, and that, in
order to obtain it he had wandered all over the world in search of some
one who could teach him &ldquo;the trade that no one knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king and his daughter heard this, they gladly fulfilled
their part of the bargain, seeing how well the young man had fulfilled
his.</p>
<p>Then, shortly afterwards, the king&rsquo;s daughter married the son
of the poor old couple; and the king built for the princess and her
husband a palace close to his own. There they lived long and had plenty
of children, and people say that some of their descendants are living
at present, and that these go constantly to pray in the church, which
is always open because the key of it turned itself into a young man who
married the king&rsquo;s daughter, after he had shown to her that he
had done as she wished, and learnt, for her sake, &ldquo;the trade that
no one knows.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6694" class="main">XX. The Golden-haired Twins</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, a long, long while ago, there lived
a young king who wished very much to marry, but could not decide where
he had better look for a wife.</p>
<p>One evening as he was walking disguised through the streets of his
capital, as it was his frequent custom to do, he stopped to listen near
an open window where he heard three young girls chatting gaily
together.</p>
<p>The girls were talking about a report which had been lately spread
through the city, that the king intended soon to marry.</p>
<p>One of the girls exclaimed: &ldquo;If the king would marry me I
would give him a son who should be the greatest hero in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second girl said: &ldquo;And if I were to be his wife I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>would present him with two sons at
once&mdash;the twins with golden hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the third girl declared that were the king to marry <i>her</i>,
she would give him a daughter so beautiful that there should not be her
equal in the whole wide world!</p>
<p>The young king listened to all this, and for some time thought over
their words, and tried to make up his mind which of the three girls he
should choose for a wife. At last he decided that he would marry the
one who had said she would bring him twins with golden hair.</p>
<p>Having once settled this in his own mind, he ordered that all
preparations for his marriage should be made forthwith, and shortly
after, when all was ready, he married the second girl of the three.</p>
<p>Several months after his marriage the young king, who was at war
with one of the neighbouring princes, received tidings of the defeat of
his army, and heard that his presence was immediately required in the
camp. He accordingly left his capital and went to his army, leaving the
young queen in his palace to the care of his stepmother.</p>
<p>Now the king&rsquo;s stepmother hated her daughter-in-law very much
indeed, so when the young queen was near her confinement, the old queen
told her that it was always customary in the royal family for the heirs
to the throne to be born in a garret.</p>
<p>The young queen (who knew nothing about the customs in royal
families except what she had learnt from hearing or seeing since her
marriage to the king) believed implicitly what her mother-in-law told
her, although she thought it a great pity to leave her splendid
apartments and go up into a miserable attic.</p>
<p>Now when the golden-haired twins were born, the old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>queen contrived to steal them out of their
cradle, and put in their place two ugly little dogs. She then caused
the two beautiful golden-haired boys to be buried alive in an
out-of-the-way spot in the palace gardens, and then sent word to the
king that the young queen had given him two little dogs instead of the
heirs he was hoping for. The wicked stepmother said in her letter to
the king that she herself was not surprised at this, though she was
very sorry for his disappointment. As to herself, she had a long time
suspected the young queen of having too great a friendship for goblins
and elves, and all kinds of evil spirits.</p>
<p>When the king received this letter, he fell into a frightful rage,
because he had only married the young girl in order to have the
golden-haired twins she had promised him as heirs to his throne.</p>
<p>So he sent word back to the old queen that his wife should be put at
once into the dampest dungeon in the castle, an order which the wicked
woman took good care to see carried out without delay. Accordingly the
poor young queen was thrown into a miserably dark dungeon under the
palace, and <span class="corr" id="xd19e6732" title=

<div class="div3 section" id="xd19e6735">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6736" class="main">The Plight of the Young Queen</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now there was only a very small hole in this
prison&mdash;hardly enough to let in light and air&mdash;yet the old
queen managed to cause a great many people to pass by this hole, and
whoever passed was ordered to spit at and abuse the unhappy young
queen, calling out to her, &ldquo;Are you really the queen? Are you the
girl who cheated the king in order to be a queen? Where are your
golden-haired twins? You cheated the king and your friends, and now the
witches have cheated you!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356"
href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the young king, though terribly angry and mortified at his great
disappointment, was, at the same time, too sad and troubled to be
willing to return to his palace. So he remained away for fully nine
years. When he at last consented to return, the first thing he noticed
in the palace gardens were two fine young trees, exactly the same size
and the same shape.</p>
<p>These trees had both golden leaves and golden blossoms, and had
grown up of themselves from the very spot where the stepmother of the
king had buried the two golden-haired boys she had stolen from their
cradle.</p>
<p>The king admired these two trees exceedingly, and was never weary of
looking at them. This, however, did not at all please the old queen,
for she knew that the two young princes were buried just where the
trees grew, and she always feared that by some means what she had done
would come to the king&rsquo;s ears. She therefore pretended that she
was very sick, and declared that she was sure she should die unless her
stepson, the king, ordered the two golden-leaved trees to be cut down,
and a bed made for her out of their wood.</p>
<p>As the king was not willing to be the cause of her death, he ordered
that her wishes should be attended to, notwithstanding he was
exceedingly sorry to lose his favourite trees.</p>
<p>A bed was soon made from the two trees, and the seemingly sick old
queen was laid on it as she desired. She was quite delighted that the
golden-leaved trees had disappeared from the garden; but when midnight
came, she could not sleep a bit, for it seemed to her that she heard
the boards of which her bed was made in conversation with each
other!</p>
<p>At last it seemed to her, that one board said, quite plainly,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>&ldquo;How are you, my brother?&rdquo; And the
other board answered: &ldquo;Thank you, I am very well; how are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am all right,&rdquo; returned the first board;
&ldquo;but I wonder how our poor mother is in her dark dungeon! Perhaps
she is hungry and thirsty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wicked old queen could not sleep a minute all night, after
hearing this conversation between the boards of her new bed; so next
morning she got up very early and went to see the king. She thanked him
for attending to her wish, and said she already was much better, but
she felt quite sure she would never recover thoroughly unless the
boards of her new bed were cut up and thrown into a fire. The king was
sorry to lose entirely even the boards made out of his two favourite
trees, nevertheless he could not refuse to use the means pointed out
for his step-mother&rsquo;s perfect recovery.</p>
<p>So the new bed was cut to pieces and thrown into the fire. But
whilst the boards were blazing and crackling, two sparks from the fire
flew into the courtyard, and in the next moment two beautiful lambs
with golden fleeces and golden horns were seen gambolling about the
yard.</p>
<p>The king admired them greatly, and made many inquiries who had sent
them there, and to whom they belonged. He even sent the public crier
many times through the city, calling on the owners of the
golden-fleeced lambs to appear and claim them; but no one came, so at
length he thought he might fairly take them as his own property.</p>
<p>The king took very great care of these two beautiful lambs, and
every day directed that they should be well fed and attended to; this,
however, did not at all please his stepmother. She could not endure
even to look on the lambs with their golden fleeces and golden horns,
for they always reminded her of the golden-haired twins. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>So,
in a little while she pretended again to be dangerously sick, and
declared she felt sure that she should soon die unless the two lambs
were killed and cooked for her.</p>
<p>The king was even fonder of his golden-fleeced lambs than he had
been of the golden-leaved trees, but he could not long resist the tears
and prayers of the old queen, especially as she seemed to be very ill.
Accordingly, the lambs were killed, and a servant was ordered to carry
their golden fleeces down to the river and to wash the blood well out
of them. But whilst the servant held them under the water, they
slipped, in some way or other, out of his fingers, and floated down the
stream, which just at that place flowed very rapidly. Now it happened
that a hunter was passing near the river a little lower down, and, as
he chanced to look in the water, he saw something strange in it. So he
stepped into the stream, and soon fished out a small box which he
carried to his house, and there opened it. To his unspeakably great
surprise, he found in the box two golden-haired boys. Now the hunter
had no children of his own; he therefore adopted the twins he had
fished out of the river, and brought them up just as if they had been
his own sons. When the twins were grown up into handsome young men, one
of them said to his foster-father, &ldquo;Make us two suits of
beggar&rsquo;s clothes, and let us go and wander a little about the
world!&rdquo; The hunter, however, replied and said: &ldquo;No, I will
have a fine suit made for each of you, such as is fitting for two such
noble-looking young men.&rdquo; But as the twins begged hard that he
should not spend his money uselessly in buying fine clothes, telling
him that they wished to travel about as beggars, the hunter&mdash;who
always liked to do as his two handsome foster-sons wished&mdash;did as
they desired, and ordered two suit of clothes, like those worn by
beggars, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>to be prepared for them. The two sons then
dressed themselves up as beggars, and as well as they could hid their
beautiful golden locks, and then set out to see the world. They took
with them a goussle and cymbal, and maintained themselves with their
singing and playing.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 id="xd19e6773" class="main">The King&rsquo;s Sons</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They had wandered about in this way some time when one
day they came to the king&rsquo;s palace. As the afternoon was already
pretty far advanced, the young musicians begged to allowed to pass the
night in one of the out-buildings belonging to the court, as they were
poor men, and quite strangers in the city. The old queen, however, who
happened to be just then in the courtyard, saw them, and hearing their
request said sharply that beggars could not be permitted to enter any
part of the king&rsquo;s palace. The two travellers said they had hoped
to pay for their night&rsquo;s lodging by their songs and music, as one
of them played and sung to the goussle, and the other to the
cymbal.</p>
<p>The old queen, however, was not moved by this, but insisted on their
going away at once. Happily for the two brothers, the king himself came
out into the courtyard just as his stepmother angrily ordered them to
go away, and at once directed his servants to find a place for the
musicians to sleep in, and ordered them to provide the brothers with a
good supper. After they had supped, the king commanded them to be
brought before him that he might judge of their skill as musicians, and
that their singing might help him to pass the time more pleasantly.</p>
<p>Accordingly, after the two young men had taken the refreshment
provided for them, the servants took them into the king&rsquo;s
presence, and they began to sing this ballad:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty bird, the swallow, built her nest with care in the
palace of the king. In the nest she reared up happily two of her little
ones. A black, ugly-looking bird, however came to the swallow&rsquo;s
nest to mar her happiness and to kill her two little ones. And the ugly
black bird succeeded in destroying the happiness of the poor little
swallow; the little ones, however, although yet weak and unfledged were
saved, and, when they were grown up and able to fly, they came to look
at the palace where their mother, the pretty swallow, had built her
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strange song the two minstrels sung so very sweetly that the
king was quite charmed, and asked them the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>Whereupon the two meanly dressed young men took off their hats, so
that the rich tresses of their golden hair fell down over their
shoulders, and the light glanced so brightly upon it that the whole
hall was illuminated by the shining. They then stepped forward
together, and told the king all that had happened to them and to their
mother, and convinced him that they were really his own sons.</p>
<p>The king was exceedingly angry when he heard all the cruel things
his stepmother had done, and he gave orders that she should be burnt to
death. He then went with the two golden-haired princes to the miserable
dungeon wherein his unfortunate wife had been confined so many years,
and brought her once more into her beautiful palace. There, looking on
her golden-haired sons, and seeing how much the king, their father,
loved them, she soon forgot all her long years of misery. As to the
king, he felt that he could never do enough to make amends for all the
misfortunes his queen had lived through, and all the dangers to which
his twin sons had been exposed. He felt that he had too easily believed
the stories of the old queen, because he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>would not trouble
himself to inquire more particularly into the truth or falsehood of the
strange things she had told him.</p>
<p>After all this mortification, and trouble, and misery, everything
came right at last. So the king and his wife, with their golden-haired
twins, lived together long and happily. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">A townsman went one day to the country to hunt and
came at noon to the house of a peasant whom he knew. The man asked him
to share his dinner, and while they were eating, the townsman looked
around him and noticed that there was but little arable land to be
seen. There were rocks and stones in abundance, however. Surprised at
this, the townsman exclaimed: &ldquo;In the name of all that is good,
my friend, how on earth can you good people of this village exist
without arable land! and whence these heaps of rocks and stones?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is, indeed, a great misfortune!&rdquo; answered the peasant.
&ldquo;People say that our ancestors heard from their fore-fathers that
when our Lord walked on this earth, St. Peter accompanied Him carrying
on his back a sack full of sand. Occasionally our Lord would take a
grain of sand and throw it down to make a mountain, saying: &lsquo;May
this grain multiply!&rsquo; When they arrived here St. Peter&rsquo;s
sack burst and half of its contents poured out in our
village.&rdquo;</p>

recommended a lottery, but the Christians, well knowing that they, as
the cleverest, would be able to obtain the most desirable gifts, and
not wishing to be at the mercy of fortune, suggested (and the idea was
instantly adopted by all) that each should express <span class=

noted that he was alone, and greedily coveting his fine carriage
horses, determined to deprive him of them. As the carriage approached,
they rushed on to the road, respectfully took off their hats, knelt
before him, and one of them began to speak, saying: &ldquo;O how happy
we are to have an opportunity of manifesting to you, O most gracious
lord, our deep gratitude for the noble deeds and many acts of kindness

have no valuable presents to offer you, allow us to harness ourselves

form of courtesy. Two gipsies thereupon detached the horses, harnessed
themselves to the carriage and drew it for some distance. Suddenly,
however, they cut themselves loose and ran back to the <span class=

<p class="first">A Turk and his wife halted in the shadow of a tree.
The Turk went to the river to water his horse, and his wife remained to
await his return. Just then an Era passed by and saluted the Turkish
woman: &ldquo;Allah help you, noble lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;May God aid
you,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;whence do you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
come from the Other World, noble lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;As you have been
in the Other World, have you not, perchance, seen there my son Mouyo,
who died a few months ago?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, how could I help seeing
him? He is my immediate neighbour.&rdquo; &ldquo;Happy me! How is he,
then?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is well, may God be praised! But he could stand
just a little more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365"
name="pb365">365</a>]</span>tobacco and some more pocket-money to pay
for black coffee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you going back again? And if so,
would you be so kind as to deliver to him this purse with his
parent&rsquo;s greetings?&rdquo; The Era took the money protesting that
he would be only too glad to convey so pleasant a surprise to the
youth, and hurried away. Soon the Turk came back, and his wife told him
what had transpired. He perceived at once that she had been victimized
and without stopping to reproach her, he mounted his horse and galloped
after the Era, who, observing the pursuit, and guessing at once that
the horseman was the husband of the credulous woman, made all the speed
that he could. There was a mill near by and making for it, the Era
rushed in and addressed the miller with: &ldquo;For Goodness&rsquo;
sake, brother, fly! There is a Turkish horseman coming with drawn
sword; he will kill you. I heard him say so and have hurried to warn
you in time.&rdquo; The miller had no time to ask for particulars; he
knew how cruel the Turks were, and without a word he dashed out of the
mill and fled up the adjacent rocks.</p>
<p>Meantime the Era placed the miller&rsquo;s hat upon his own head and
sprinkled flour copiously over his clothes, that he might look like a
miller. No sooner was this done than the Turk came up. Alighting from
his horse, he rushed into the mill and hurriedly asked the Era where he
had hidden the thief. The Era pointed indifferently to the flying
miller on the rock, whereupon the Turk requested him to take care of
his horse while he ran and caught the swindler. When the Turk was gone
some distance up the hill our Era brushed his clothes, swiftly mounted
the horse and galloped away. The Turk caught the real miller, and
demanded: &ldquo;Where is the money <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

wife, swindler?&rdquo; The poor miller made the sign of the
cross<a class="noteref" id="xd19e6851src" href="#xd19e6851" name=

back to his wife, and she, seeing that her husband had no horse, asked
in surprise: &ldquo;Where did you go, and what became of your
horse?&rdquo; The Turk replied: &ldquo;You sent money to our darling
son; so I thought I had better send him the horse that he need not go

<h3 id="xd19e6862" class="main">A Trade before Everything</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time a king set out in his luxurious
pleasure-galley accompanied by his queen and a daughter. They had
proceeded a very little way from the shore when a powerful wind drove
the galley far out to sea, where at last it was dashed upon a barren
rock. Fortunately there was a small boat upon the galley, and the king,
being a good sailor, was able to launch this frail bark, and he rescued
his wife and daughter from the waves. After long tossing and drifting,
good fortune smiled upon the wanderers; they began to see birds and
floating leaves, which indicated that they were approaching dry land.
And, indeed, they soon came in sight of shore, and, as the sea was now
calm, were able to land without further adventure. But, alas, the king
knew no trade, and had no money upon his person. Consequently he was
forced to offer his services as a shepherd to a rich landowner, who
gave him a hut and a flock of sheep to tend. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>In
these idyllic and simple conditions they lived contentedly for several
years, undisturbed by regrets for the magnificence of their past
circumstances.</p>
<p>One day the only son of the ruler of that strange country lost his
way while riding in the neighbourhood after a fox, and presently he
beheld the beautiful daughter of our shepherd. No sooner did his eyes
fall upon the maiden than he fell violently in love with her, and she
was not unwilling to receive the protestations of undying affection
which he poured into her ears. They met again and again, and the maiden
consented to marry the prince, provided her parents would approve the
match.</p>
<p>The prince first declared his wish to his own parents, who, of
course, were greatly astonished at their son&rsquo;s apparently foolish
selection, and would not give their consent. But the prince protested
solemnly that his resolution was unshakable; he would either marry the
girl he loved or remain single all his days. Finally his royal father
took pity on him, and sent his first adjutant to the shepherd secretly
to ask the hand of his daughter for the prince.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e6873" class="main">The Condition</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the adjutant came and communicated the royal
message, the shepherd asked him: &ldquo;Is there any trade with which
the royal prince is familiar?&rdquo; The adjutant was amazed at such a
question. &ldquo;Lord forbid, foolish man!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;how could you expect the heir-apparent to know a trade? People
learn trades in order to earn their daily bread; princes possess lands
and cities, and so do not need to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the shepherd persisted, saying: &ldquo;If the prince knows no
trade, he cannot become my son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The royal courier returned to the palace and reported to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>the king his conversation with the shepherd, and
great was the astonishment throughout the palace when the news became
known, for all expected that the shepherd would be highly flattered
that the king had chosen his daughter&rsquo;s hand for the prince in
preference to the many royal and imperial princesses who would have
been willing to marry him for the asking.</p>
<p>The king sent again to the shepherd, but the man remained firm in
his resolution. &ldquo;As long as the prince,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;does not know any trade, I shall not grant him the hand of my
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this second official brought back to the palace the same
answer, the king informed his son of the shepherd&rsquo;s condition,
and the royal prince resolved to put himself in the way of complying
with it.</p>
<p>His first step was to go through the city from door to door in order
to select some simple and easy trade. As he walked through the streets
he beheld various craftsmen at their work, but he did not stay until he
came to the workshop of a carpet-maker, and this trade appeared to him
both easy and lucrative. He therefore offered his services to the
master, who gladly undertook to teach him the trade. In due time the
prince obtained a certificate of efficiency, and he went to the
shepherd and showed it to him, together with samples of his hand work.
The shepherd examined these and asked the prince: &ldquo;How much could
you get for this carpet?&rdquo; The prince replied: &ldquo;If it is
made of grass, I could sell it for threepence.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, that
is a splendid trade,&rdquo; answered the shepherd, &ldquo;threepence
to-day and another threepence to-morrow would make sixpence, and in two
other days you would have earned a shilling! If I only had known this
trade a few years ago I would not have been a shepherd.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>Thereupon he related to the prince and his suite
the story of his past life, and what ill fate had befallen him, to the
greatest surprise of all. You may be sure that the prince rejoiced to
learn that his beloved was highly born, and the worthy mate of a
king&rsquo;s son. As for his father, he was especially glad that his
son had fallen in love, not with the daughter of a simple shepherd, but
with a royal princess.</p>
<p>The marriage was now celebrated with great magnificence, and when
the festivities came to an end, the king gave the shepherd a fine ship,
together with a powerful escort, that he might go back to his country
and reassume possession of his royal throne. <span class=

<p><i>ou</i> is pronounced also as <i>oo</i> in &ldquo;boot.&rdquo;
Closed or semi-closed vowels are unknown to the Serbian tongue.</p>
<p>The twenty-five consonants are pronounced as in English, with the
following exceptions:</p>
<p><i>h</i> at the beginning of words or syllables is always
aspirated.</p>
<p><i>r</i> is always rolled. In a Serbian monosyllable it sometimes
plays the part of a vowel between two consonants, <i>e.g. vrt</i>
(garden).</p>
<p>The combinations <i>ts</i> or <i>tz</i>, as in &ldquo;tsar,&rdquo;
&ldquo;tzarina,&rdquo; etc., are pronounced like <i>ts</i> in
&ldquo;its.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>y</i> has been used in the English forms of Serbian names not as
a vowel but invariably as a consonant, as in &ldquo;year.&rdquo; This
consonantal <i>y</i> has been used often after the consonants <i>d</i>,
<i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, and <i>t</i>, and <i>y</i> is then merged into the
preceding consonant to form one sound. For example, <i>dy</i> becomes
very like the sound of <i>j</i> in &ldquo;jaw,&rdquo; as in the word
&ldquo;Dyourady,&rdquo; which is pronounced <i>Joo-radg</i>.</p>
<p><i>z</i> in the names &ldquo;Zdral&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zabylak&rdquo;
is pronounced like <i>s</i> in &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;; elsewhere it is
pronounced as in English.</p>
<p>The Serbian language being phonetic does not employ double
consonants, diphthongs or triphthongs. The thirty letters represent
always the same thirty sounds, and the position of the written symbol
does not affect or qualify its sound.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
